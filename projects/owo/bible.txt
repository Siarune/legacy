27 howbeit we know thiws man

awnd thewe was a division among

 17 they say unto the bwind man
again, whawt sayest thou of him, thawt

wiwt thou gow up tuwu jewusawem, awnd

awnd whewn saiwing was now dangewous, because the a fawst was now awweady past, pauw admonished thewm,

thawt we shouwd be saved was then

 21 but aftew wong abstinence pauw

awnd cast out the wheat intwo the sea.

thawt was confiwmed befowe of god

 23 but he who was of the bondwoman was bown aftew the fwesh; but
he of the fweewoman was by pwomise.
 24 which things awe an awwegowy: fow

fwom the mount sinai, which gendeweth tuwu a bondage, which iws bagaw.
