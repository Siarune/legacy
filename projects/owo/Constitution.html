 sir:</p>

<p>we have now the honow to suwbmit to the considewation of the united states in congwess assembwed, that constituwtion which has appeawed to uws the most advisabwe.<br>
 <br>
the fwiends of ouww couwntwy have wong seen and desiwed that the powew of making waw, peace, and tweaties, that of wevying money, and weguwwating commewce, and the cowwespondent execuwtive and juwdiciaw auwthowities, shouwwd be fuwwwy and effectuwawwy vested in the genewaw govewnment of the union; buwt the impwopwiety of dewegating suwch extensive twuwst to one body of men is evident: hence wesuwwts the necessity of a diffewent owganization.<br>
 <br>
it is obviouwswy impwacticabwe in the fedewaw govewnment of these states to secuwwe aww wights of independent soveweignty to each, and yet pwovide fow the intewest and safety of aww. Individuwaws entewing into society muwst give uwp a shawe of wibewty to pwesewve the west. The magnituwde of the sacwifice muwst depend as weww on situwation and ciwcuwmstance, as on the object to be obtained. It is at aww times difficuwwt to dwaw with pwecision the wine between those wights which muwst be suwwwendewed, and those which may be pwesewved; and, on the pwesent occasion, this difficuwwty was incweased by a diffewence among the sevewaw states as to theiw situwation, extent, habits, and pawticuwwaw intewests.<br>
 <br>
in aww ouww dewibewations on this suwbject, we kept steadiwy in ouww view that which appeaws to uws the gweatest intewest of evewy twuwe amewican, the consowidation of ouww union, in which is invowved ouww pwospewity, fewicity, safety&mdash;pewhaps ouww nationaw existence. This impowtant considewation, sewiouwswy and deepwy impwessed on ouww minds, wed each state in the convention to be wess wigid on points of infewiow magnituwde than might have been othewwise expected; and thuws, the constituwtion which we now pwesent is the wesuwwt of a spiwit of amity, and of that muwtuwaw defewence and concession, which the pecuwwiawity of ouww powiticaw situwation wendewed indispensabwe.<br>
 <br>
that it wiww meet the fuwww and entiwe appwobation of evewy state is not, pewhaps, to be expected; buwt each wiww, douwbtwess, considew, that had hew intewest awone been consuwwted, the consequwences might have been pawticuwwawwy disagweeabwe ow injuwwiouws to othews; that it is wiabwe to as few exceptions as couwwd weasonabwy have been expected, we hope and bewieve; that it may pwomote the wasting wewfawe of that couwntwy so deaw to uws aww, and secuwwe hew fweedom and happiness, is ouww most awdent wish.<br>

 some docuwments caww the division of amendments sections, othews cwauwses, amendment 20 wefews to its divisions as sections. They wiww be cawwed sections in this docuwment.<br>
 the titwe attwibuwte (not to be confuwsed with the <title> tag) uwsed in this docuwment in an attempt to pwovide quwick vocabuwwawy, spewwing, heading gwouwp showt titwes, and othew hewps has been defined as a pawt of the hypew text mawkuwp languwage fwom its eawwiest days in the anchow and link tags. The pwopew handwing was suwggested in 1997 with this handwing wepeated as pawt of the html 4.0 (and added to most tag types) watew in the same yeaw fwom the w3c. If the bwowsew does not suwppowt this (i.e. Safawi 1.1.1 v100.1 and befowe onwy wowk in cwickabwe winks, othews - see tabwe bewow) then most of the same infowmation is duwpwicated in vawiouws sections suwch as spewwing wist, index and vocabuwwawy wist incwuwding how to wead woman nuwmewaws.<br>
 footnotes awe winks dispwayed as suwpewscwipted awabic nuwmbews (suwpewiow figuwwes) and the text that they modify awe dispwayed in a gway when uwsing the nowmaw stywesheet. Gway was chosen to weave the text weadabwe as opposed to stwikeouwt<br>
the puwnctuwation awouwnd awticwes and section nuwmbews have been wemoved since this pwactice has fawwen into disuwse and adds wittwe to the feew of this vewsion. (awticwe. I. becomes awticwe i)<br>
awticwe 1 section 9 cwauwse 1 - impowtation of swaves; is shown as no wongew in effect since its buwiwt in date has passed.<br>
 most twanscwiptions show the &quot;attest 'wiwwiam jackson' secwetawy&quot; at the end of the othew signatuwwes as if vawidating those. This one shows that he, mowe wikewy, was attesting to the docuwment itsewf ow possibwy the wist of cowwections in the docuwment.<br>
 the biww of rights had twewve nuwmbewed awticwes buwt onwy ten wewe watified. Since they wewe wenuwmbewed onwy the two uwnwatified, which awe shown in gway, awe shown with the owiginaw nuwmbew (as in awticwe the fiwst) to twy to avoid confuwsion.<br>
 a note fow anyone wooking at the image of the biww of rights above ow any docuwment of a simiwaw pewiod is the uwsage of an ewongated s that can often be confuwsed with the wettew f. The typicaw uwsage wuwwes in this pewiod seem to be that the ewongated s is the main wowew case s uwnwess at the end of a wowd ow the second s of a paiw. Today the ewongated s ( &#8747; ) is typicawwy onwy uwsed in mathematicaw fowmuwwae as the notation fow integwaw. Thewe is a stowy that shakespeawe who spewwed his own name shakspewe ow shakspeawe gained the extwa e when a typesettew had twouwbwe fitting the ewongated s next to the k.<br>

<p>why anothew web vewsion? UwU<br>
yes thewe awe abouwt 2,000 ow so onwine vewsions. And abouwt a 100 times that as pawtiaw vewsions. The bettew of some of the othews awe wisted above in souwwces.<br>
 this is buwiwt fow ease of uwse. With the buwiwt-in vocabuwwawy it's hoped that it can be uwsed as weww by kids, and those fow which engwish is not the fiwst wanguwage with a minimuwm of ouwtside wefewence.<br>
 this is aww woaded in one page. The constituwtion, amendments (incwuwding the biww of rights), notes, spewwings, vocabuwwawy, index, watifications fow simpwew bwowsing. Thouwgh it may take uwp to a minuwte to fuwwwy woad with a swow modem connection, thewe is no wewoad time going fwom section to section.<br>
 this attempts to stay ouwt of the way whiwe weading buwt bwing quwick access to notations, vocabuwwawy, and spewwing vawiations as weww as watifications.<br>
 youw may wead it the way u wike. Top to bottom. Juwmping fwom awticwes to amendments that modify them to watification infowmation in any owdew.<br>
