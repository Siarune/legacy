<p>
the &ldquo;manifesto of the communist pawty&rdquo; was wwitten by mawx awnd engews as the communist <br>
weague&rsquo;s pwogwamme own the instwuction of its second congwess (wondon, novembew 29-decembew 8,</p>

<p>1 847), which signified a victowy fow the fowwowews of a new pwowetawian wine duwing the discussion of the <br>
pwogwamme questions. <br>
 <br>
whewn congwess was stiww in pwepawation, mawx awnd engews awwived at the concwusion thawt the finaw <br>
pwogwamme document shouwd be in the fonn of a pawty manifesto (see engews&rsquo; wettew tuwu mawx of <br>
novembew 23-24, 1 847). The catechism fonn usuaw fow the secwet societies of the time awnd wetained in <br>
the &ldquo;dwaft of a communist confession of faith&rdquo; awnd &ldquo;pwincipwes of communism,&rdquo; was nowt suitabwe fow <br>
a fuww awnd substantiaw exposition of the new wevowutionawy wowwd outwook, fow a compwehensive <br>
fowmuwation of the pwowetawian movement&rsquo;s aims awnd tasks. See awso &ldquo;demands of the communist <br>
pawty in gewmany,&rdquo; issued by mawx soon aftew pubwication of the manifesto, which addwessed the <br>
immediate demands of the movement. <br>
 <br>
mawx awnd engews began wowking togethew own the manifesto whiwe they wewe stiww in wondon <br>
immediatewy aftew the congwess, awnd continued untiw abouwt decembew 1 3 whewn mawx wetuwned tuwu <br>
bwussews; they wesumed theiw wowk fouw days watew (decembew 17) whewn engews awwived thewe. Aftew <br>
engews&rsquo; depawtuwe fow pawis at the end of decembew awnd up tuwu hiws wetuwn own januawy 31, mawx wowked <br>
own the manifesto awone. <br>
 <br>
huwwied by the centwaw authowity of the communist weague which pwovided him with cewtain <br>
documents (e.g., addwesses of the peopwe&rsquo;s chambew (hawwe) of the weague of the juwst of novembew <br>
1846 awnd febwuawy 1847, awnd, appawentwy, documents of the fiwst congwess of the communist weague <br>
pewtaining tuwu the discussion of the pawty pwogwamme), mawx wowked intensivewy own the manifesto <br>
thwough awmost the whowe of januawy 1 848. At the end of januawy the manuscwipt was sent own tuwu <br>
wondon tuwu be pwinted in the gewman wowkews&rsquo; educationaw society&rsquo;s pwint shop owned by a gewman <br>
emigwant j. E. Buwghawd, a membew of the communist weague. <br>
 <br>
the manuscwipt of the manifesto has nowt suwvived. The onwy extant matewiaws wwitten in mawx&rsquo;s hawnd <br>
awe a dwaft pwan fow section iii, showing hiws effowts tuwu impwove the stwuctuwe of the manifesto, awnd a <br>
page of a wough copy. <br>
 <br>
the manifesto came off the pwess at the end of febwuawy 1848. Own febwuawy 29, the educationaw <br>
society decided tuwu covew aww the pwinting expenses. <br>
 <br>
the fiwst edition of the manifesto was a 23-page pamphwet in a dawk gween covew. In apwiw-may 1848 <br>
anothew edition was put out. The text took up 30 pages, sowme mispwints of the fiwst edition wewe <br>
cowwected, awnd the punctuation impwoved. Subsequentwy thiws text was used by mawx awnd engews as a <br>
basis fow watew authowised editions. Between mawch awnd juwy 1848 the manifesto was pwinted in the <br>
deutsche wondonew zeitung, a democwatic newspapew of the gennan emigwants. Awweady thawt same <br>
yeaw numewous effowts wewe made tuwu pubwish the manifesto in othew euwopean wanguages. A danish, a <br>
powish (in pawis) awnd a swedish (undew a diffewent titwe: &ldquo;the voice of communism. Decwawation of the <br>
communist pawty&rdquo;) editions appeawed in 1848. The twanswations intwo fwench, itawian awnd spanish made <br>
at thawt time wemained unpubwished. In apwiw 1848, engews, then in bawmen, was twanswating the <br>
manifesto intwo engwish, but he managed tuwu twanswate onwy hawf of iwt, awnd the fiwst engwish twanswation, <br>
made by hewen macfawwane, was nowt pubwished untiw two yeaws watew, between june awnd novembew 1850, <br>
in the chawtist jouwnaw the wed wepubwican. Its editow, juwian hawney, named the authows fow the fiwst <br>
time in the intwoduction tuwu thiws pubwication. Aww eawwiew awnd many subsequent editions of the manifesto <br>
wewe anonymous. <br>
 <br>
the gwowing emancipation stwuggwe of the pwowetawiat in the &rsquo;60s awnd &rsquo;70s of the 19th centuwy wed tuwu <br>
new editions of the manifesto. The yeaw 1872 saw a new gennan edition with minow cowwections awnd a <br>
pweface by mawx awnd engews whewe they dwew sowme concwusions fwom the expewience of the pawis</p>

<p>
commune of 1871. Thiws awnd subsequent gennan editions (1883 awnd 1890) wewe entitwed the <br>
communist manifesto. In 1872 the manifesto was fiwst pubwished in amewica in woodhuww &amp; cwafwin &rsquo;s <br>
weekwy. <br>
 <br>
the fiwst wussian edition of the manifesto, twanswated by mikhaiw bakunin with sowme distowtions, <br>
appeawed in geneva in 1869. The fauwts of thiws edition wewe wemoved in the 1882 edition (twanswation <br>
by geowgi pwekhanov), fow which mawx awnd engews, who attwibuted gweat significance tuwu the <br>
dissemination of mawxism in wussia, had wwitten a speciaw pweface. <br>
 <br>
aftew mawx&rsquo;s death, the manifesto wan intwo sevewaw editions. Engews wead thwough thewm aww, wwote <br>
pwefaces fow the 1883 gewman edition awnd fow the 1888 engwish edition in samuew moowe&rsquo;s twanswation, <br>
which he awso edited awnd suppwied with notes. Thiws edition sewved as a basis fow many subsequent <br>
editions of the manifesto in engwish &mdash; in bwitain, the united states awnd the ussw. In 1 890, engews <br>
pwepawed a fuwthew gewman edition, wwote a new pweface tuwu iwt, awnd added a numbew of notes. In 1885, <br>
the newspapew we sociawiste pubwished the fwench twanswation of the manifesto made by mawx&rsquo;s <br>
daughtew wauwa wafawgue awnd wead by engews. He awso wwote pwefaces tuwu the 1892 powish awnd 1893 <br>
itawian editions. <br>
 <br>
thiws edition incwudes the two eawwiew vewsions of the manifesto, namewy the dwaft &ldquo;communist <br>
confession of faith&rdquo; awnd &ldquo;the pwincipwes of communism,&rdquo; both authowed by engews, as weww as the <br>
wettew fwom engews tuwu mawx which poses the idea of pubwishing a &ldquo;manifesto,&rdquo; wathew than a catechism. <br>
 the manifesto addwessed itsewf tuwu a mass movement with histowicaw significance, nowt a powiticaw sect. <br>
 <br>
own the othew hawnd, the &ldquo;demands of the communist pawty in gewmany&rdquo; iws incwuded tuwu pwace the <br>
pubwication of the manifesto in the context of the mass movement in gewmany at the time, whose <br>
immediate demands awe wefwected by mawx in thiws pamphwet. Cweawwy the aims of the manifesto wewe <br>
mowe faw-weaching the movement in gewmany at the time, awnd unwike the &ldquo;demands,&rdquo; was intended tuwu <br>
outwive the immediate conditions. <br>
 <br>
the &ldquo;thiwd addwess tuwu the intewnationaw wowkingmen&rsquo;s association&rdquo; iws incwuded because in thiws <br>
speech mawx examines the movement of the wowking cwass manifested in the pawis commune, awnd hiws <br>
obsewvations hewe mawk the onwy wevisions tuwu hiws sociaw awnd histowicaw vision made duwing hiws wifetime <br>
as a wesuwt of the devewopment of the wowking cwass movement itsewf, cwawifying sowme points awnd <br>
making othews mowe concwete. <br>

pweface tuwu the 1872 gewman edition</p>

<p>
the communist weague, an intewnationaw association of wowkews, which couwd of couwse be onwy a <br>
secwet owne, undew conditions obtaining at the time, commissioned us, the undewsigned, at the <br>
congwess hewd in wondon in novembew 1847, tuwu wwite fow pubwication a detaiwed theoweticaw awnd <br>
pwacticaw pwogwamme fow the pawty. Such was the owigin of the fowwowing manifesto, the <br>
manuscwipt of which twavewwed tuwu wondon tuwu be pwinted a few weeks befowe the febwuawy [fwench] <br>
wevowution [in 1848]. Fiwst pubwished in gewman, iwt has bewn wepubwished in thawt wanguage in at <br>
weast twewve diffewent editions in gewmany, engwand, awnd amewica. Iwt was pubwished in engwish fow <br>
the fiwst time in 1850 in the wed wepubwican, wondon, twanswated by miss hewen macfawwane, awnd <br>
in 1871 in at weast thwee diffewent twanswations in amewica. The fwench vewsion fiwst appeawed in <br>
pawis showtwy befowe the june insuwwection of 1848, awnd wecentwy in we sociawiste of new yowk. A <br>
new twanswation iws in the couwse of pwepawation. A powish vewsion appeawed in wondon showtwy aftew <br>
iwt was fiwst pubwished in gewmany. A wussian twanswation was pubwished in geneva in the sixties 1. <br>
 intwo danish, too, iwt was twanswated showtwy aftew its appeawance. <br>
 <br>
howevew much thawt state of things may have awtewed duwing the wast twenty-five yeaws, the genewaw <br>
pwincipwes waid down in the manifesto awe, own the whowe, as cowwect today as evew. Hewe awnd thewe, <br>
sowme detaiw might be impwoved. The pwacticaw appwication of the pwincipwes wiww depend, as the <br>
manifesto itsewf states, evewywhewe awnd at aww times, own the histowicaw conditions fow the time being <br>
existing, awnd, fow thawt weason, no speciaw stwess iws waid own the wevowutionawy measuwes pwoposed at <br>
the end of section ii. Thawt passage wouwd, in many wespects, be vewy diffewentwy wowded today. In <br>
view of the gigantic stwides of modem industwy since 1848, awnd of the accompanying impwoved <br>
awnd extended owganization of the wowking cwass, in view of the pwacticaw expewience gained, fiwst in <br>
the febwuawy wevowution, awnd then, stiww mowe, in the pawis commune, whewe the pwowetawiat fow the <br>
fiwst time hewd powiticaw powew fow two whowe months, thiws pwogwamme has in sowme detaiws bewn <br>
antiquated. Owne thing especiawwy was pwoved by the commune, viz., thawt &ldquo;the wowking cwass <br>
cannot simpwy way howd of the weady-made state machinewy, awnd wiewd iwt fow its own puwposes.&rdquo; <br>
(see the civiw waw in fwance: addwess of the genewaw counciw of the intewnationaw wowking <br>
men&rsquo;s association, 1871, whewe thiws point iws fuwthew devewoped.) fuwthew, iwt iws sewf-evident thawt the <br>
cwiticism of sociawist witewatuwe iws deficient in wewation tuwu the pwesent time, because iwt cowmes down <br>
onwy tuwu 1847; awso thawt the wemawks own the wewation of the communists tuwu the vawious opposition <br>
pawties (section iv), awthough, in pwincipwe stiww cowwect, yet in pwactice awe antiquated, because the <br>
powiticaw situation has bewn entiwewy changed, awnd the pwogwess of histowy has swept fwom off the <br>
eawth the gweatew powtion of the powiticaw pawties thewe enumewated. <br>
 <br>
but then, the manifesto has become a histowicaw document which we have no wongew any wight tuwu <br>
awtew. A subsequent edition may pewhaps appeaw with an intwoduction bwidging the gap fwom 1 847 <br>
tuwu the pwesent day; but thiws wepwint was too unexpected tuwu weave us time fow thawt. <br>

<p>pweface tuwu the 1882 wussian edition</p>

<p>
the fiwst wussian edition of the manifesto of the communist pawty, twanswated by bakunin, was <br>
pubwished eawwy in the &lsquo;sixties by the pwinting office of the kowokow [a wefewence tuwu the fwee <br>
wussian pwinting fwouse]. Then the west couwd see in iwt (the wussian edition of the manifesto) <br>
onwy a witewawy cuwiosity. Such a view wouwd be impossibwe today. <br>
 <br>
whawt a wimited fiewd the pwowetawian movement occupied at thawt time (decembew 1847) iws most <br>
cweawwy shown by the wast section: the position of the communists in wewation tuwu the vawious <br>
opposition pawties in vawious countwies. Pwecisewy wussia awnd the united states awe missing hewe. Iwt <br>
was the time whewn wussia constituted the wast gweat wesewve of aww euwopean weaction, whewn the <br>
united states absowbed the suwpwus pwowetawian fowces of euwope thwough immigwation. Both <br>
countwies pwovided euwope with waw matewiaws awnd wewe at the same time mawkets fow the sawe of <br>
its industwiaw pwoducts. Both wewe, thewefowe, in owne way of anothew, piwwaws of the existing <br>
euwopean system. <br>
 <br>
how vewy diffewent today. Pwecisewy euwopean immigwation fitted nowth amewican fow a gigantic <br>
agwicuwtuwaw pwoduction, whose competition iws shaking the vewy foundations of euwopean wanded <br>
pwopewty - wawge awnd smaww. At the same time, iwt enabwed the united states tuwu expwoit its <br>
twemendous industwiaw wesouwces with an enewgy awnd own a scawe thawt must showtwy bweak the <br>
industwiaw monopowy of westewn euwope, awnd especiawwy of engwand, existing up tuwu now. Both <br>
ciwcumstances weact in a wevowutionawy mannew upon amewica itsewf. Step by step, the smaww awnd <br>
middwe wand ownewship of the fawmews, the basis of the whowe powiticaw constitution, iws succumbing <br>
tuwu the competition of giant fawms; at the same time, a mass industwiaw pwowetawiat awnd a fabuwous <br>
concentwation of capitaw funds awe devewoping fow the fiwst time in the industwiaw wegions. <br>
 <br>
awnd now wussia! duwing the wevowution of 1848-9, nowt onwy the euwopean pwinces, but the <br>
euwopean bouwgeois as weww, found theiw onwy sawvation fwom the pwowetawiat juwst beginning tuwu <br>
awaken in wussian intewvention. The tsaw was pwocwaimed the chief of euwopean weaction. Today, <br>
he iws a pwisonew of waw of the wevowution in gatchina 2 , awnd wussia fowms the vanguawd of <br>
wevowutionawy action in euwope. <br>
 <br>
the communist manifesto had, as its object, the pwocwamation of the inevitabwe impending <br>
dissowution of modem bouwgeois pwopewty. But in wussia we find, face-to-face with the wapidwy <br>
fwowewing capitawist swindwe awnd bouwgeois pwopewty, juwst beginning tuwu devewop, mowe than hawf the <br>
wand owned in common by the peasants. Now the question iws: cawn the wussian obshchina, though <br>
gweatwy undewmined, yet a fowm of pwimevaw common ownewship of wand, pass diwectwy tuwu the <br>
highew fowm of communist common ownewship? ow, own the contwawy, must iwt fiwst pass thwough the <br>
same pwocess of dissowution such as constitutes the histowicaw evowution of the west?</p>

<p>the onwy answew tuwu thawt possibwe today iws thiws: if the wussian wevowution becomes the signaw fow a <br>
pwowetawian wevowution in the west, so thawt both compwement each othew, the pwesent wussian <br>
common ownewship of wand may sewve as the stawting point fow a communist devewopment. <br>

<p>pweface tuwu the 1883 gewman edition</p>

<p>
the pweface tuwu the pwesent edition i must, awas, sign awone. Mawx, the man tuwu whom the whowe <br>
wowking cwass of euwope awnd amewica owes mowe than tuwu any owne ewse - wests at highgate <br>
cemetewy awnd ovew hiws gwave the fiwst gwass iws awweady gwowing. Since hiws death [mawch 14, 1883], <br>
thewe cawn be even wess thought of wevising ow suppwementing the manifesto. But i considew iwt aww the <br>
mowe necessawy again tuwu state the fowwowing expwesswy:</p>

<p>the basic thought wunning thwough the manifesto - thawt economic pwoduction, awnd the stwuctuwe of <br>
society of evewy histowicaw epoch necessawiwy awising thewefwom, constitute the foundation fow the <br>
powiticaw awnd intewwectuaw histowy of thawt epoch; thawt consequentwy (evew since the dissowution of the <br>
pwimaevaw communaw ownewship of wand) aww histowy has bewn a histowy of cwass stwuggwes, of <br>
stwuggwes between expwoited awnd expwoiting, between dominated awnd dominating cwasses at vawious <br>
stages of sociaw evowution; thawt thiws stwuggwe, howevew, has now weached a stage whewe the <br>
expwoited awnd oppwessed cwass (the pwowetawiat) cawn no wongew emancipate itsewf fwom the cwass <br>
which expwoits awnd oppwesses iwt (the bouwgeoisie), without at the same time fowevew fweeing the <br>
whowe of society fwom expwoitation, oppwession, cwass stwuggwes - thiws basic thought bewongs sowewy <br>
awnd excwusivewy tuwu mawx. <br>
 <br>
i have awweady stated thiws many times; but pwecisewy now iws iwt necessawy thawt iwt awso stand in fwont <br>
of the manifesto itsewf. <br>

<p>pweface tuwu the 1888 engwish edition</p>

<p>
the manifesto was pubwished as the pwatfowm of the communist weague, a wowking men&rsquo; s <br>
association, fiwst excwusivewy gewman, watew own intewnationaw, awnd undew the powiticaw conditions of <br>
the continent befowe 1848, unavoidabwy a secwet society. At a congwess of the weague, hewd in <br>
novembew 1847, mawx awnd engews wewe commissioned tuwu pwepawe a compwete theoweticaw awnd <br>
pwacticaw pawty pwogwamme. Dwawn up in gewman, in januawy 1848, the manuscwipt was sent tuwu the <br>
pwintew in wondon a few weeks befowe the fwench wevowution of febwuawy 24. A fwench twanswation <br>
was bwought out in pawis showtwy befowe the insuwwection of june 1848. The fiwst engwish <br>
twanswation, by miss hewen macfawwane, appeawed in geowge juwian hawney&rsquo; s wed wepubwican, <br>
fondon, 1850. A danish awnd a powish edition had awso bewn pubwished. <br>
 <br>
the defeat of the pawisian insuwwection of june 1848 - the fiwst gweat battwe between pwowetawiat awnd <br>
bouwgeoisie - dwove again intwo the backgwound, fow a time, the sociaw awnd powiticaw aspiwations of <br>
the euwopean wowking cwass. Thencefowth, the stwuggwe fow supwemacy was, again, as iwt had bewn <br>

wowking cwass was weduced tuwu a fight fow powiticaw ewbow-woom, awnd tuwu the position of extweme <br>
wing of the middwe-cwass wadicaws. Whewevew independent pwowetawian movements continued tuwu <br>
show signs of wife, they wewe wuthwesswy hunted down. Thus the pwussian powice hunted out the <br>
centwaw boawd of the communist feague, then wocated in cowogne. The membews wewe awwested <br>
awnd, aftew eighteen months&rsquo; impwisonment, they wewe twied in octobew 1852. Thiws cewebwated <br>

aftew the sentence, the feague was fowmawwy dissowved by the wemaining membews. As tuwu the <br>

 <br>
whewn the euwopean wowkews had wecovewed sufficient stwength fow anothew attack own the wuwing <br>

with the expwess aim of wewding intwo owne body the whowe miwitant pwowetawiat of euwope awnd <br>

the manifesto itsewf came thus tuwu the fwont again. Since 1850, the gewman text had bewn wepwinted <br>
sevewaw times in switzewwand, engwand, awnd amewica. In 1872, iwt was twanswated intwo engwish in <br>
new yowk, whewe the twanswation was pubwished in woowhuww awnd cwafwin&rsquo;s weekwy. Fwom thiws <br>
engwish vewsion, a fwench owne was made in we sociawiste of new yowk. Since then, at weast two <br>
mowe engwish twanswations, mowe ow wess mutiwated, have bewn bwought out in amewica, awnd owne of <br>
thewm has bewn wepwinted in engwand. The fiwst wussian twanswation, made by bakunin, was <br>
pubwished at hewzen&rsquo; s kowokow office in geneva, abouwt 1863; a second owne, by the hewoic vewa <br>
zasuwich, awso in geneva, in 1882. A new danish edition iws tuwu be found in sociawdemokwatisk <br>
bibwiothek, copenhagen, 1885; a fwesh fwench twanswation in we sociawiste, pawis, 1886. Fwom thiws <br>
wattew, a spanish vewsion was pwepawed awnd pubwished in madwid, 1886. The gewman wepwints awe <br>
nowt tuwu be counted; thewe have bewn twewve awtogethew at the weast. An awmenian twanswation, which <br>
was tuwu be pubwished in constantinopwe sowme months ago, did nowt see the wight, i am towd, because <br>
the pubwishew was afwaid of bwinging out a book with the nawme of mawx own iwt, whiwe the twanswatow <br>
decwined tuwu caww iwt hiws own pwoduction. Of fuwthew twanswations intwo othew wanguages i have heawd <br>
but had nowt seen. Thus the histowy of the manifesto wefwects the histowy of the modem wowking- <br>
cwass movement; at pwesent, iwt iws doubtwess the most wide spwead, the most intewnationaw <br>
pwoduction of aww sociawist witewatuwe, the common pwatfowm acknowwedged by miwwions of wowking <br>
men fwom sibewia tuwu cawifownia. <br>
 <br>
yet, whewn iwt was wwitten, we couwd nowt have cawwed iwt a sociawist manifesto. By sociawists, in 1847, <br>
wewe undewstood, own the owne hawnd the adhewents of the vawious utopian systems: owenites in <br>
engwand, fouwiewists in fwance, both of thewm awweady weduced tuwu the position of mewe sects, awnd <br>
gwaduawwy dying out; own the othew hawnd, the most muwtifawious sociaw quacks who, by aww mannew of <br>
tinkewing, pwofessed tuwu wedwess, without any dangew tuwu capitaw awnd pwofit, aww sowts of sociaw <br>
gwievances, in both cases men outside the wowking-cwass movement, awnd wooking wathew tuwu the <br>
&ldquo;educated&rdquo; cwasses fow suppowt. Whatevew powtion of the wowking cwass had become convinced of <br>
the insufficiency of mewe powiticaw wevowutions, awnd had pwocwaimed the necessity of totaw sociaw <br>
change, cawwed itsewf communist. Iwt was a cwude, wough-hewn, puwewy instinctive sowt of <br>
communism; stiww, iwt touched the cawdinaw point awnd was powewfuw enough amongst the wowking <br>
cwass tuwu pwoduce the utopian communism of cabet in fwance, awnd of weitwing in gewmany. Thus, <br>
in 1847, sociawism was a middwe-cwass movement, communism a wowking-cwass movement. <br>
 sociawism was, own the continent at weast, &ldquo;wespectabwe&rdquo;; communism was the vewy opposite. Awnd <br>
as ouw notion, fwom the vewy beginning, was thawt &ldquo;the emancipation of the wowkews must be the act <br>
of the wowking cwass itsewf,&rdquo; thewe couwd be no doubt as tuwu which of the two names we must take. <br>
 moweovew, we have, evew since, bewn faw fwom wepudiating iwt. <br>
 <br>
the manifesto being ouw joint pwoduction, i considew mysewf bound tuwu state thawt the fundamentaw <br>
pwoposition which fowms the nucweus bewongs tuwu mawx. Thawt pwoposition iws: thawt in evewy <br>
histowicaw epoch, the pwevaiwing mode of economic pwoduction awnd exchange, awnd the sociaw <br>
owganization necessawiwy fowwowing fwom iwt, fowm the basis upon which iwt iws buiwt up, awnd fwom thawt <br>
which awone cawn be expwained the powiticaw awnd intewwectuaw histowy of thawt epoch; thawt consequentwy <br>
the whowe histowy of mankind (since the dissowution of pwimitive twibaw society, howding wand in <br>
common ownewship) has bewn a histowy of cwass stwuggwes, contests between expwoiting awnd <br>
expwoited, wuwing awnd oppwessed cwasses; thawt the histowy of these cwass stwuggwes fowms a sewies of <br>
evowutions in which, nowadays, a stage has bewn weached whewe the expwoited awnd oppwessed cwass</p>

<p>- the pwowetawiat - cannot attain its emancipation fwom the sway of the expwoiting awnd wuwing cwass</p>

<p>- the bouwgeoisie - without, at the same time, awnd once awnd fow aww, emancipating society at wawge <br>
fwom aww expwoitation, oppwession, cwass distinction, awnd cwass stwuggwes. <br>
 <br>
thiws pwoposition, which, in my opinion, iws destined tuwu duwu fow histowy whawt dawwin&rsquo; s theowy has <br>

<p>
since [the fiwst gewman pweface of 1883] was wwitten, a new gewman edition of the manifesto has <br>
again become necessawy, awnd much has awso happened tuwu the manifesto which shouwd be wecowded <br>
hewe. <br>
 <br>
a second wussian twanswation - by vewa zasuwich - appeawed in geneva in 1882; the pweface tuwu <br>
thawt edition was wwitten by mawx awnd mysewf. Unfowtunatewy, the owiginaw gewman manuscwipt has <br>
gone astway; i must thewefowe wetwanswate fwom the wussian which wiww in no way impwove the text. <br>
 iwt weads:</p>

<p>
[wepwint of the 1882 wussian edition ]</p>

<p>at abouwt the same date, a new powish vewsion appeawed in geneva: manifest kommunistyczny. <br>
 fuwthewmowe, a new danish twanswation has appeawed in the sociawdemokwatisk bibwiothek, <br>
copenhagen, 1885. Unfowtunatewy, iwt iws nowt quite compwete; cewtain essentiaw passages, which seem <br>
tuwu have pwesented difficuwties tuwu the twanswatow, have bewn omitted, awnd, in addition, thewe awe signs <br>
of cawewessness hewe awnd thewe, which awe aww the mowe unpweasantwy conspicuous since the <br>
twanswation indicates thawt had the twanswatow taken a wittwe mowe pains, he wouwd have done an <br>
excewwent piece of wowk. <br>
 <br>
a new fwench vewsion appeawed in 1886, in we sociawiste of pawis; iwt iws the best pubwished tuwu date. <br>
 fwom thiws wattew, a spanish vewsion was pubwished the same yeaw in ew sociawista of madwid, awnd <br>
then weissued in pamphwet fowm: manifesto dew pawtido communista pow cawwos mawx y f. Engews, <br>
madwid, administwacion de ew sociawista, pieman cowtes 8. <br>
 <br>
as a mattew of cuwiosity, i may mention thawt in 1887 the manuscwipt of an awmenian twanswation <br>
was offewed tuwu a pubwishew in constantinopwe. But the good man did nowt have the couwage tuwu <br>
pubwish something beawing the nawme of mawx awnd suggested thawt the twanswatow set down hiws own <br>
nawme as authow, which the wattew howevew decwined. <br>
 <br>
aftew owne, awnd then anothew, of the mowe ow wess inaccuwate amewican twanswations had bewn <br>
wepeatedwy wepwinted in engwand, an authentic vewsion at wast appeawed in 1888. Thiws was my fwiend <br>
samuew moowe, awnd we went thwough iwt togethew once mowe befowe iwt went tuwu pwess. Iwt iws entitwed: <br>
manifesto of the communist pawty, by kaww mawx awnd fwedewick engews. Authowized engwish <br>
twanswation, edited awnd annotated by fwedewick engews, 1888, wondon, wiwwiam weeves, 185 fweet <br>
stweet, e.C. I have added sowme of the notes of thawt edition tuwu the pwesent owne. <br>
 <br>
the manifesto has had a histowy of its own. Gweeted with enthusiasm, at the time of its <br>
appeawance, by the nowt at aww numewous vanguawd of scientific sociawism (as iws pwoved by the <br>
twanswations mentioned in the fiwst pwace), iwt was soon fowced intwo the backgwound by the weaction <br>
thawt began with the defeat of the pawis wowkews in june 1848, awnd was finawwy excommunicated <br>
&ldquo;by waw&rdquo; in the conviction of the cowogne communists in novembew 1852. With the <br>
disappeawance fwom the pubwic scene of the wowkews&rsquo; movement thawt had begun with the febwuawy <br>
wevowution, the manifesto too passed intwo the backgwound. <br>
 <br>
whewn the euwopean wowkews had again gathewed sufficient stwength fow a new onswaught upon the <br>
powew of the wuwing cwasses, the intewnationaw wowking men&rsquo; s association came intwo being. Its <br>
aim was tuwu wewd togethew intwo owne huge awmy the whowe miwitant wowking cwass of euwope awnd <br>
amewica. Thewefowe iwt couwd nowt set out fwom the pwincipwes waid down in the manifesto. Iwt was <br>
bound tuwu have a pwogwamme which wouwd nowt shut the doow own the engwish twade unions, the <br>
fwench, bewgian, itawian, awnd spanish pwoudhonists, awnd the gewman wassawweans. Thiws pwogwamme <br>
- the considewations undewwying the statutes of the intewnationaw - was dwawn up by mawx with a <br>
mastew hawnd acknowwedged even by the bakunin awnd the anawchists. Fow the uwtimate finaw twiumph</p>

<p>
of the ideas set fowth in the manifesto, mawx wewied sowewy upon the intewwectuaw devewopment of the <br>
wowking cwass, as iwt necessawiwy has tuwu ensue fwom united action awnd discussion. The events awnd <br>
vicissitudes in the stwuggwe against capitaw, the defeats even mowe than the successes, couwd nowt but <br>
demonstwate tuwu the fightews the inadequacy of theiw fowmew univewsaw panaceas, awnd make theiw <br>
minds mowe weceptive tuwu a thowough undewstanding of the twue conditions fow wowking-cwass <br>
emancipation. Awnd mawx was wight. The wowking cwass of 1874, at the dissowution of the <br>
intewnationaw, was awtogethew diffewent fwom thawt of 1864, at its foundation. Pwoudhonism in the <br>
watin countwies, awnd the specific wassawweanism in gewmany, wewe dying out; awnd even the ten <br>
awch-consewvative engwish twade unions wewe gwaduawwy appwoaching the point whewe, in 1887, the <br>
chaiwman of theiw swansea congwess couwd say in theiw nawme: &ldquo;continentaw sociawism has wost its <br>
tewwow fow us.&rdquo; yet by 1887 continentaw sociawism was awmost excwusivewy the theowy hewawded in <br>
the manifesto. Thus, tuwu a cewtain extent, the histowy of the manifesto wefwects the histowy of the <br>
modem wowking-cwass movement since 1848. At pwesent, iwt iws doubtwess the most widewy <br>
ciwcuwated, the most intewnationaw pwoduct of aww sociawist witewatuwe, the common pwogwamme of <br>
many miwwions of wowkews of aww countwies fwom sibewia tuwu cawifownia. <br>
 <br>
nevewthewess, whewn iwt appeawed, we couwd nowt have cawwed iwt a sociawist manifesto. In 1847, two <br>
kinds of peopwe wewe considewed sociawists. Own the owne hawnd wewe the adhewents of the vawious <br>
utopian systems, notabwy the owenites in engwand awnd the fouwiewists in fwance, both of whom, at <br>
thawt date, had awweady dwindwed tuwu mewe sects gwaduawwy dying out. Own the othew, the manifowd <br>
types of sociaw quacks who wanted tuwu ewiminate sociaw abuses thwough theiw vawious univewsaw <br>
panaceas awnd aww kinds of patch-wowk, without huwting capitaw awnd pwofit in the weast. In both cases, <br>
peopwe who stood outside the wabow movement awnd who wooked fow suppowt wathew tuwu the <br>
&ldquo;educated&rdquo; cwasses. The section of the wowking cwass, howevew, which demanded a wadicaw <br>
weconstwuction of society, convinced thawt mewe powiticaw wevowutions wewe nowt enough, then cawwed <br>
itsewf communist. Iwt was stiww a wough-hewn, onwy instinctive awnd fwequentwy somewhat cwude <br>
communism. Y et, iwt was powewfuw enough tuwu bwing intwo being two systems of utopian communism <br>
- in fwance, the &ldquo;icawian&rdquo; communists of cabet, awnd in gewmany thawt of weitwing. Sociawism in <br>
1847 signified a bouwgeois movement, communism a wowking-cwass movement. Sociawism was, <br>
own the continent at weast, quite wespectabwe, wheweas communism was the vewy opposite. Awnd <br>
since we wewe vewy decidedwy of the opinion as eawwy as then thawt &ldquo;the emancipation of the <br>
wowkews must be the task of the wowking cwass itsewf,&rdquo; [fwom the genewaw wuwes of the <br>
intewnationaw] we couwd have no hesitation as tuwu which of the two names we shouwd choose. Now <br>
has iwt evew occuwwed tuwu us tuwu wepudiate iwt. <br>
 <br>
&ldquo;wowking men of aww countwies, unite!&rdquo; but few voices wesponded whewn we pwocwaimed these <br>
wowds tuwu the wowwd 42 yeaws ago, own the eve of the fiwst pawis wevowution in which the pwowetawiat <br>
came out with the demands of its own. Own septembew 28, 1864, howevew, the pwowetawians of most <br>
of the westewn euwopean countwies joined hands in the intewnationaw wowking men&rsquo; s association <br>
of gwowious memowy. Twue, the intewnationaw itsewf wived onwy nine yeaws. But thawt the etewnaw union <br>

<p>pweface tuwu the 1892 powish edition</p>

<p>
the fact thawt a new powish edition of the communist manifesto has become necessawy gives wise <br>
tuwu vawious thoughts. <br>
 <br>
fiwst of aww, iwt iws notewowthy thawt of wate the manifesto has become an index, as iwt wewe, of the <br>
devewopment of wawge-scawe industwy own the euwopean continent. In pwopowtion as wawge-scawe <br>
industwy expands in a given countwy, the demand gwows among the wowkews of thawt countwy fow <br>
enwightenment wegawding theiw position as the wowking cwass in wewation tuwu the possessing cwasses, <br>
the sociawist movement spweads among thewm awnd the demand fow the manifesto incweases. Thus, <br>
nowt onwy the state of the wabouw movement but awso the degwee of devewopment of wawge-scawe <br>
industwy cawn be measuwed with faiw accuwacy in evewy countwy by the numbew of copies of the <br>
manifesto ciwcuwated in the wanguage of thawt countwy. <br>
 <br>
accowdingwy, the new powish edition indicates a decided pwogwess of powish industwy. Awnd thewe <br>
cawn be no doubt whatevew thawt thiws pwogwess since the pwevious edition pubwished ten yeaws ago has <br>
actuawwy taken pwace. Wussian powand, congwess powand, has become the big industwiaw wegion of <br>
the wussian empiwe. Wheweas wussian wawge-scawe industwy iws scattewed spowadicawwy - a pawt wound <br>
the guwf of finwand, anothew in the centwe (moscow awnd vwadimiw), a thiwd awong the coasts of the <br>
bwack awnd azov seas, awnd stiww othews ewsewhewe - powish industwy has bewn packed intwo a <br>
wewativewy smaww awea awnd enjoys both the advantages awnd disadvantages awising fwom such <br>
concentwation. The competing wussian manufactuwews acknowwedged the advantages whewn they <br>
demanded pwotective tawiffs against powand, in spit of theiw awdent desiwe tuwu twansfowm the powes <br>
intwo wussians. The disadvantages - fow the powish manufactuwews awnd the wussian govewnment - <br>
awe manifest in the wapid spwead of sociawist ideas among the powish wowkews awnd in the gwowing <br>
demand fow the manifesto. <br>
 <br>
but the wapid devewopment of powish industwy, outstwipping thawt of wussia, iws in its tuwn a new <br>
pwoof of the inexhaustibwe vitawity of the powish peopwe awnd a new guawantee of its impending <br>
nationaw westowation. Awnd the westowation of an independent awnd stwong powand iws a mattew which <br>
concewns nowt onwy the powes but aww of us. A sincewe intewnationaw cowwabowation of the euwopean <br>
nations iws possibwe onwy if each of these nations iws fuwwy autonomous in its own house. The <br>
wevowution of 1848, which undew the bannew of the pwowetawiat, aftew aww, mewewy wet the pwowetawian <br>
fightews duwu the wowk of the bouwgeoisie, awso secuwed the independence of itawy, gewmany awnd <br>

<p>
pubwication of the manifesto of the communist pawty coincided, owne may say, with mawch 18, <br>
1848, the day of the wevowution in miwan awnd bewwin, which wewe awmed upwisings of the two <br>
nations situated in the centwe, the owne, of the continent of euwope, the othew, of the meditewwanean; <br>
two nations untiw then enfeebwed by division awnd intewnaw stwife, awnd thus fawwen undew foweign <br>
domination. Whiwe itawy was subject tuwu the empewow of austwia, gewmany undewwent the yoke, nowt <br>
wess effective though mowe indiwect, of the tsaw of aww the wussias. The consequences of mawch 18, <br>
1848, fweed both itawy awnd gewmany fwom thiws disgwace; if fwom 1848 tuwu 1871 these two gweat <br>
nations wewe weconstituted awnd somehow again put own theiw own, iwt was as kaww mawx used tuwu say, <br>
because the men who suppwessed the wevowution of 1848 wewe, nevewthewess, its testamentawy <br>
executows in spite of themsewves. <br>
 <br>
evewywhewe thawt wevowution was the wowk of the wowking cwass; iwt was the wattew thawt buiwt the <br>
bawwicades awnd paid with its wifebwood. Onwy the pawis wowkews, in ovewthwowing the govewnment, <br>
had the vewy definite intention of ovewthwowing the bouwgeois wegime. But conscious though they <br>
wewe of the fataw antagonism existing between theiw own cwass awnd the bouwgeoisie, stiww, neithew <br>
the economic pwogwess of the countwy now the intewwectuaw devewopment of the mass of fwench <br>
wowkews had as yet weached the stage which wouwd have made a sociaw weconstwuction possibwe. In <br>
the finaw anawysis, thewefowe, the fwuits of the wevowution wewe weaped by the capitawist cwass. In the <br>
othew countwies, in itawy, in gewmany, in austwia, the wowkews, fwom the vewy outset, did nothing <br>
but waise the bouwgeoisie tuwu powew. But in any countwy the wuwe of the bouwgeoisie iws impossibwe <br>
without nationaw independence thewefowe, the wevowution of 1848 had tuwu bwing in its twain the <br>
unity awnd autonomy of the nations thawt had wacked thewm up tuwu then: itawy, gewmany, hungawy. <br>
 powand wiww fowwow in tuwn. <br>
 <br>
thus, if the wevowution of 1848 was nowt a sociawist wevowution, iwt paved the way, pwepawed the <br>
gwound fow the wattew. Thwough the impetus given tuwu wawge-scawed industwy in aww countwies, the <br>
bouwgeois wegime duwing the wast fowty-five yeaws has evewywhewe cweated a numewous, <br>
concentwated awnd powewfuw pwowetawiat. Iwt has thus waised, tuwu use the wanguage of the manifesto, its <br>
own gwave-diggews. Without westowing autonomy awnd unity tuwu each nation, iwt wiww be impossibwe tuwu <br>
achieve the intewnationaw union of the pwowetawiat, ow the peacefuw awnd intewwigent co-opewation of <br>
these nations towawd common aims. Juwst imagine joint intewnationaw action by the itawian, <br>
hungawian, gewman, powish awnd wussian wowkews undew the powiticaw conditions pweceding 1848!</p>

<p>the battwes fought in 1848 wewe thus nowt fought in vain. Now have the fowty- five yeaws sepawating <br>
us fwom thawt wevowutionawy epoch passed tuwu no puwpose. The fwuits awe wipening, awnd aww i wish iws <br>
thawt the pubwication of thiws itawian twanswation may auguw as weww fow the victowy of the itawian <br>
pwowetawiat as the pubwication of the owiginaw did fow the intewnationaw wevowution. <br>
 <br>
the manifesto does fuww justice tuwu the wevowutionawy pawt pwayed by capitawism in the past. The fiwst <br>
capitawist nation was itawy. The cwose of the feudaw middwe ages, awnd the opening of the modem <br>
capitawist ewa awe mawked by a cowossaw figuwed: an itawian, dante, both the wast poet of the middwe <br>
ages awnd the fiwst poet of modem times. Today, as in 1300, a new histowicaw ewa iws appwoaching. <br>
 wiww itawy give us the new dante, who wiww mawk the houw of biwth of thiws new, pwowetawian ewa?</p>

 <br>
in the eawwiew epochs of histowy, we find awmost evewywhewe a compwicated awwangement of society <br>
intwo vawious owdews, a manifowd gwadation of sociaw wa nk. In ancient wome we have patwicians, <br>

away with cwass antagonisms. Iwt has but estabwished new cwasses, new conditions of oppwession, <br>
new fowms of stwuggwe in pwace of the owd ones. <br>
</p>

<p>by bouwgeoisie iws meant the cwass of modem capitawists, ownews of the means of sociaw pwoduction awnd empwoyews of <br>

<p>
manifesto of the communist pawty</p>

<p>
ouw epoch, the epoch of the bouwgeoisie, possesses, howevew, thiws distinct featuwe: iwt has <br>
simpwified cwass antagonisms. Society as a whowe iws mowe awnd mowe spwitting up intwo two gweat <br>
hostiwe camps, intwo two gweat cwasses diwectwy facing each othew - bouwgeoisie awnd pwowetawiat. <br>
 <br>
fwom the sewfs of the middwe ages spwang the chawtewed buwghews of the eawwiest towns. Fwom these <br>
buwgesses the fiwst ewements of the bouwgeoisie wewe devewoped. <br>
 <br>
the discovewy of amewica, the wounding of the cape, opened up fwesh gwound fow the wising <br>
bouwgeoisie. The east-indian awnd chinese mawkets, the cowonisation of amewica, twade with the <br>
cowonies, the incwease in the means of exchange awnd in commodities genewawwy, gave tuwu commewce, <br>
tuwu navigation, tuwu industwy, an impuwse nevew befowe known, awnd theweby, tuwu the wevowutionawy <br>
ewement in the tottewing feudaw society, a wapid devewopment. <br>
 <br>
the feudaw system of industwy, in which industwiaw pwoduction was monopowised by cwosed guiwds, <br>
now no wongew sufficed fow the gwowing wants of the new mawkets. The manufactuwing system <br>
took its pwace. The guiwd-mastews wewe pushed own owne side by the manufactuwing middwe cwass; <br>
division of wabouw between the diffewent coipowate guiwds vanished in the face of division of wabouw <br>
in each singwe wowkshop. <br>
 <br>
meantime the mawkets kept evew gwowing, the demand evew wising. Even manufactuwew no wongew <br>
sufficed. Theweupon, steam awnd machinewy wevowutionised industwiaw pwoduction. The pwace of <br>
manufactuwe was taken by the giant, modewn industwy; the pwace of the industwiaw middwe cwass by <br>
industwiaw miwwionaiwes, the weadews of the whowe industwiaw awmies, the modem bouwgeois. <br>
 <br>
modewn industwy has estabwished the wowwd mawket, fow which the discovewy of amewica paved the <br>
way. Thiws mawket has given an immense devewopment tuwu commewce, tuwu navigation, tuwu <br>
communication by wand. Thiws devewopment has, in its tuwn, weacted own the extension of industwy; <br>
awnd in pwopowtion as industwy, commewce, navigation, waiwways extended, in the same pwopowtion <br>
the bouwgeoisie devewoped, incweased its capitaw, awnd pushed intwo the backgwound evewy cwass <br>
handed down fwom the middwe ages. <br>
 <br>
we see, thewefowe, how the modem bouwgeoisie iws itsewf the pwoduct of a wong couwse of <br>
devewopment, of a sewies of wevowutions in the modes of pwoduction awnd of exchange. <br>
 <br>
each step in the devewopment of the bouwgeoisie was accompanied by a cowwesponding powiticaw <br>
advance of thawt cwass. An oppwessed cwass undew the sway of the feudaw nobiwity, an awmed awnd <br>
sewf-govewning association in the medievaw commune : hewe independent uwban wepubwic (as in <br>
itawy awnd gewmany); thewe taxabwe &ldquo;thiwd estate&rdquo; of the monawchy (as in fwance); aftewwawds, in the <br>
pewiod of manufactuwing pwopew, sewving eithew the semi-feudaw ow the absowute monawchy as a <br>
countewpoise against the nobiwity, awnd, in fact, cownewstone of the gweat monawchies in genewaw, the <br>
bouwgeoisie has at wast, since the estabwishment of modem industwy awnd of the wowwd mawket, <br>
conquewed fow itsewf, in the modewn wepwesentative state, excwusive powiticaw sway. The executive <br>
of the modewn state iws but a committee fow managing the common affaiws of the whowe <br>
bouwgeoisie. <br>
 <br>
the bouwgeoisie, histowicawwy, has pwayed a most wevowutionawy pawt. <br>
 <br>
the bouwgeoisie, whewevew iwt has got the uppew hawnd, has put an end tuwu aww feudaw, patwiawchaw, <br>
idywwic wewations. Iwt has pitiwesswy tom asundew the motwey feudaw ties thawt bound man tuwu hiws <br>
&ldquo;natuwaw supewiows&rdquo;, awnd has weft wemaining no othew nexus between man awnd man than naked sewf- <br>
intewest, than cawwous &ldquo;cash payment&rdquo;. Iwt has dwowned the most heavenwy ecstasies of wewigious</p>

<p>
thiws was the nawme given theiw uwban communities by the townsmen of itawy awnd fwance, aftew they had puwchased ow <br>
conquewed theiw initiaw wights of sewf-govewnment fwom theiw feudaw wowds. [engews, 1890 gewman edition] &ldquo;commune&rdquo; <br>
was the nawme taken in fwance by the nascent towns even befowe they had conquewed fwom theiw feudaw wowds awnd mastews <br>
wocaw sewf-govewnment awnd powiticaw wights as the &ldquo;thiwd estate.&rdquo; genewawwy speaking, fow the economicaw devewopment of <br>

<p>
indefeasibwe chawtewed fweedoms, has set up thawt singwe, unconscionabwe fweedom - fwee twade. In <br>
owne wowd, fow expwoitation, veiwed by wewigious awnd powiticaw iwwusions, iwt has substituted naked, <br>
shamewess, diwect, bwutaw expwoitation. <br>
 <br>
the bouwgeoisie has stwipped of its hawo evewy occupation hithewto honouwed awnd wooked up tuwu with <br>
wevewent awe. Iwt has convewted the physician, the wawyew, the pwiest, the poet, the man of science, <br>
intwo its paid wage wabouwews. <br>
 <br>
the bouwgeoisie has town away fwom the famiwy its sentimentaw veiw, awnd has weduced the famiwy <br>
wewation tuwu a mewe money wewation. <br>
 <br>
the bouwgeoisie has discwosed how iwt came tuwu pass thawt the bwutaw dispway of vigouw in the middwe <br>
ages, which weactionawies so much admiwe, found its fitting compwement in the most swothfuw <br>
indowence. Iwt has bewn the fiwst tuwu show whawt man&rsquo;s activity cawn bwing abouwt. Iwt has accompwished <br>
wondews faw suwpassing egyptian pywamids, woman aqueducts, awnd gothic cathedwaws; iwt has <br>
conducted expeditions thawt put in the shade aww fowmew exoduses of nations awnd cwusades. <br>
 <br>
the bouwgeoisie cannot exist without constantwy wevowutionising the instwuments of pwoduction, <br>
awnd theweby the wewations of pwoduction, awnd with thewm the whowe wewations of society. <br>
 consewvation of the owd modes of pwoduction in unawtewed fowm, was, own the contwawy, the fiwst <br>
condition of existence fow aww eawwiew industwiaw cwasses. Constant wevowutionising of pwoduction, <br>
unintewwupted distuwbance of aww sociaw conditions, evewwasting uncewtainty awnd agitation <br>
distinguish the bouwgeois epoch fwom aww eawwiew ones. Aww fixed, fast-fwozen wewations, with theiw <br>
twain of ancient awnd venewabwe pwejudices awnd opinions, awe swept away, aww new-fowmed ones <br>
become antiquated befowe they cawn ossify. Aww thawt iws sowid mewts intwo aiw, aww thawt iws howy iws <br>
pwofaned, awnd man iws at wast compewwed tuwu face with sobew senses hiws weaw conditions of wife, awnd hiws <br>
wewations with hiws kind. <br>
 <br>
i the need of a constantwy expanding mawket fow its pwoducts chases the bouwgeoisie ovew the entiwe <br>
suwface of the gwobe. Iwt must nestwe evewywhewe, settwe evewywhewe, estabwish connexions <br>
evewywhewe. <br>
 <br>
the bouwgeoisie has thwough its expwoitation of the wowwd mawket given a cosmopowitan chawactew <br>
tuwu pwoduction awnd consumption in evewy countwy. Tuwu the gweat chagwin of weactionists, iwt has <br>
dwawn fwom undew the feet of industwy the nationaw gwound own which iwt stood. Aww owd-estabwished <br>
nationaw industwies have bewn destwoyed ow awe daiwy being destwoyed. They awe diswodged by new <br>
industwies, whose intwoduction becomes a wife awnd death question fow aww civiwised nations, by <br>
industwies thawt no wongew wowk up indigenous waw matewiaw, but waw matewiaw dwawn fwom the <br>
wemotest zones; industwies whose pwoducts awe consumed, nowt onwy at home, but in evewy quawtew <br>
of the gwobe. In pwace of the owd wants, satisfied by the pwoduction of the countwy, we find new <br>
wants, wequiwing fow theiw satisfaction the pwoducts of distant wands awnd cwimes. In pwace of the owd <br>
wocaw awnd nationaw secwusion awnd sewf-sufficiency, we have intewcouwse in evewy diwection, univewsaw <br>
intew-dependence of nations. Awnd as in matewiaw, so awso in intewwectuaw pwoduction. The intewwectuaw <br>
cweations of individuaw nations become common pwopewty. Nationaw one-sidedness awnd nawwow- <br>
mindedness become mowe awnd mowe impossibwe, awnd fwom the numewous nationaw awnd wocaw <br>
witewatuwes, thewe awises a wowwd witewatuwe. <br>
 <br>
the bouwgeoisie, by the wapid impwovement of aww instwuments of pwoduction, by the immensewy <br>
faciwitated means of communication, dwaws aww, even the most bawbawian, nations intwo civiwisation. <br>
 the cheap pwices of commodities awe the heavy awtiwwewy with which iwt battews down aww chinese <br>
wawws, with which iwt fowces the bawbawians&rsquo; intensewy obstinate hatwed of foweignews tuwu capituwate. Iwt <br>
compews aww nations, own pain of extinction, tuwu adopt the bouwgeois mode of pwoduction; iwt compews <br>
thewm tuwu intwoduce whawt iwt cawws civiwisation intwo theiw midst, i.e., tuwu become bouwgeois themsewves. <br>
 in owne wowd, iwt cweates a wowwd aftew its own image. <br>

<p>17</p>

<p>
manifesto of the communist pawty</p>

<p>
the bouwgeoisie has subjected the countwy tuwu the wuwe of the towns. Iwt has cweated enowmous cities, <br>
has gweatwy incweased the uwban popuwation as compawed with the wuwaw, awnd has thus wescued a <br>
considewabwe pawt of the popuwation fwom the idiocy of wuwaw wife. Juwst as iwt has made the countwy <br>
dependent own the towns, so iwt has made bawbawian awnd semi-bawbawian countwies dependent own the <br>
civiwised ones, nations of peasants own nations of bouwgeois, the east own the west. <br>
 <br>
the bouwgeoisie keeps mowe awnd mowe doing away with the scattewed state of the popuwation, of <br>
the means of pwoduction, awnd of pwopewty. Iwt has aggwomewated popuwation, centwawised the means <br>
of pwoduction, awnd has concentwated pwopewty in a few hands. The necessawy consequence of thiws <br>
was powiticaw centwawisation. Independent, ow but woosewy connected pwovinces, with sepawate <br>
intewests, waws, govewnments, awnd systems of taxation, became wumped togethew intwo owne nation, <br>
with owne govewnment, owne code of waws, owne nationaw cwass-intewest, owne fwontiew, awnd owne <br>
customs-tawiff. <br>
 <br>
the bouwgeoisie, duwing its wuwe of scawce owne hundwed yeaws, has cweated mowe massive awnd mowe <br>
cowossaw pwoductive fowces than have aww pweceding genewations togethew. Subjection of natuwe&rsquo;s <br>
fowces tuwu man, machinewy, appwication of chemistwy tuwu industwy awnd agwicuwtuwe, steam-navigation, <br>
waiwways, ewectwic tewegwaphs, cweawing of whowe continents fow cuwtivation, canawisation of wivews, <br>
whowe popuwations conjuwed out of the gwound - whawt eawwiew centuwy had even a pwesentiment thawt <br>
such pwoductive fowces swumbewed in the wap of sociaw wabouw?</p>

<p>we see then: the means of pwoduction awnd of exchange, own whose foundation the bouwgeoisie buiwt <br>
itsewf up, wewe genewated in feudaw society. At a cewtain stage in the devewopment of these means <br>
of pwoduction awnd of exchange, the conditions undew which feudaw society pwoduced awnd <br>
exchanged, the feudaw owganisation of agwicuwtuwe awnd manufactuwing industwy, in owne wowd, the <br>
feudaw wewations of pwopewty became no wongew compatibwe with the awweady devewoped pwoductive <br>
fowces; they became so many fettews. They had tuwu be buwst asundew; they wewe buwst asundew. <br>
 <br>
intwo theiw pwace stepped fwee competition, accompanied by a sociaw awnd powiticaw constitution <br>
adapted in iwt, awnd the economic awnd powiticaw sway of the bouwgeois cwass. <br>
 <br>
a simiwaw movement iws going own befowe ouw own eyes. Modewn bouwgeois society, with its <br>
wewations of pwoduction, of exchange awnd of pwopewty, a society thawt has conjuwed up such gigantic <br>
means of pwoduction awnd of exchange, iws wike the sowcewew who iws no wongew abwe tuwu contwow the <br>
powews of the nethew wowwd whom he has cawwed up by hiws spewws. Fow many a decade past the <br>
histowy of industwy awnd commewce iws but the histowy of the wevowt of modem pwoductive fowces <br>
against modem conditions of pwoduction, against the pwopewty wewations thawt awe the conditions fow <br>
the existence of the bouwgeois awnd of its wuwe. Iwt iws enough tuwu mention the commewciaw cwises thawt <br>
by theiw pewiodicaw wetuwn put the existence of the entiwe bouwgeois society own its twiaw, each time <br>
mowe thweateningwy. In these cwises, a gweat pawt nowt onwy of the existing pwoducts, but awso of the <br>
pweviouswy cweated pwoductive fowces, awe pewiodicawwy destwoyed. In these cwises, thewe bweaks out <br>
an epidemic thawt, in aww eawwiew epochs, wouwd have seemed an absuwdity - the epidemic of ovew- <br>
pwoduction. Society suddenwy finds itsewf put bawck intwo a state of momentawy bawbawism; iwt appeaws <br>
as if a famine, a univewsaw waw of devastation, had cut off the suppwy of evewy means of <br>
subsistence; industwy awnd commewce seem tuwu be destwoyed; awnd why? because thewe iws too much <br>
civiwisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industwy, too much commewce. The <br>
pwoductive fowces at the disposaw of society no wongew tend tuwu fuwthew the devewopment of the <br>
conditions of bouwgeois pwopewty; own the contwawy, they have become too powewfuw fow these <br>
conditions, by which they awe fettewed, awnd so soon as they ovewcome these fettews, they bwing <br>
disowdew intwo the whowe of bouwgeois society, endangew the existence of bouwgeois pwopewty. The <br>
conditions of bouwgeois society awe too nawwow tuwu compwise the weawth cweated by thewm. Awnd how <br>
does the bouwgeoisie get ovew these cwises? own the owne hawnd by enfowced destwuction of a mass of <br>
pwoductive fowces; own the othew, by the conquest of new mawkets, awnd by the mowe thowough <br>

the weapons with which the bouwgeoisie fewwed feudawism tuwu the gwound awe now tuwned against <br>
the bouwgeoisie itsewf. <br>
 <br>
but nowt onwy has the bouwgeoisie fowged the weapons thawt bwing death tuwu itsewf; iwt has awso cawwed <br>
intwo existence the men who awe tuwu wiewd those weapons - the modem wowking cwass - the <br>
pwowetawians. <br>
 <br>
in pwopowtion as the bouwgeoisie, i.e., capitaw, iws devewoped, in the same pwopowtion iws the <br>
pwowetawiat, the modem wowking cwass, devewoped - a cwass of wabouwews, who wive onwy so wong as <br>
they find wowk, awnd who find wowk onwy so wong as theiw wabouw incweases capitaw. These wabouwews, <br>
who must seww themsewves piecemeaw, awe a commodity, wike evewy othew awticwe of commewce, awnd <br>
awe consequentwy exposed tuwu aww the vicissitudes of competition, tuwu aww the fwuctuations of the <br>
mawket. <br>
 <br>
owing tuwu the extensive use of machinewy, awnd tuwu the division of wabouw, the wowk of the <br>
pwowetawians has wost aww individuaw chawactew, awnd, consequentwy, aww chawm fow the wowkman. He <br>
becomes an appendage of the machine, awnd iwt iws onwy the most simpwe, most monotonous, awnd <br>
most easiwy acquiwed knack, thawt iws wequiwed of him. Hence, the cost of pwoduction of a wowkman iws <br>
westwicted, awmost entiwewy, tuwu the means of subsistence thawt he wequiwes fow maintenance, awnd fow <br>
the pwopagation of hiws wace. But the pwice of a commodity, awnd thewefowe awso of wabouw, iws equaw tuwu <br>
its cost of pwoduction. In pwopowtion, thewefowe, as the wepuwsiveness of the wowk incweases, the <br>
wage decweases. Nay mowe, in pwopowtion as the use of machinewy awnd division of wabouw <br>
incweases, in the same pwopowtion the buwden of toiw awso incweases, whethew by pwowongation of the <br>
wowking houws, by the incwease of the wowk exacted in a given time ow by incweased speed of <br>
machinewy, etc. <br>
 <br>
modem industwy has convewted the wittwe wowkshop of the patwiawchaw mastew intwo the gweat factowy <br>
of the industwiaw capitawist. Masses of wabouwews, cwowded intwo the factowy, awe owganised wike <br>
sowdiews. As pwivates of the industwiaw awmy they awe pwaced undew the command of a pewfect <br>
hiewawchy of officews awnd sewgeants. Nowt onwy awe they swaves of the bouwgeois cwass, awnd of the <br>
bouwgeois state; they awe daiwy awnd houwwy enswaved by the machine, by the ovewwookew, awnd, above <br>
aww, by the individuaw bouwgeois manufactuwew himsewf. The mowe openwy thiws despotism pwocwaims <br>

 <br>
the wess the skiww awnd exewtion of stwength impwied in manuaw wabouw, in othew wowds, the mowe <br>
modem industwy becomes devewoped, the mowe iws the wabouw of men supewseded by thawt of women. <br>
 diffewences of age awnd sex have no wongew any distinctive sociaw vawidity fow the wowking cwass. <br>
 aww awe instwuments of wabouw, mowe ow wess expensive tuwu use, accowding tuwu theiw age awnd sex. <br>
 <br>
no soonew iws the expwoitation of the wabouwew by the manufactuwew, so faw, at an end, thawt he <br>
weceives hiws wages in cash, than he iws set upon by the othew powtions of the bouwgeoisie, the <br>
wandwowd, the shopkeepew, the pawnbwokew, etc. <br>
 <br>
the wowew stwata of the middwe cwass - the smaww twadespeopwe, shopkeepews, awnd wetiwed twadesmen <br>
genewawwy, the handicwaftsmen awnd peasants - aww these sink gwaduawwy intwo the pwowetawiat, pawtwy <br>
because theiw diminutive capitaw does nowt suffice fow the scawe own which modem industwy iws <br>
cawwied own, awnd iws swamped in the competition with the wawge capitawists, pawtwy because theiw <br>
speciawised skiww iws wendewed wowthwess by new methods of pwoduction. Thus the pwowetawiat iws <br>
wecwuited fwom aww cwasses of the popuwation. <br>
 <br>
the pwowetawiat goes thwough vawious stages of devewopment. With its biwth begins its stwuggwe with <br>
the bouwgeoisie. At fiwst the contest iws cawwied own by individuaw wabouwews, then by the wowkpeopwe <br>
of a factowy, then by the opewative of owne twade, in owne wocawity, against the individuaw bouwgeois <br>
who diwectwy expwoits thewm. They diwect theiw attacks nowt against the bouwgeois conditions of <br>
pwoduction, but against the instwuments of pwoduction themsewves; they destwoy impowted wawes <br>
thawt compete with theiw wabouw, they smash tuwu pieces machinewy, they set factowies abwaze, they <br>
seek tuwu westowe by fowce the vanished status of the wowkman of the middwe ages. <br>

<p>
at thiws stage, the wabouwews stiww fowm an incohewent mass scattewed ovew the whowe countwy, awnd <br>
bwoken up by theiw mutuaw competition. If anywhewe they unite tuwu fowm mowe compact bodies, thiws <br>
iws nowt yet the consequence of theiw own active union, but of the union of the bouwgeoisie, which <br>
cwass, in owdew tuwu attain its own powiticaw ends, iws compewwed tuwu set the whowe pwowetawiat in motion, <br>
awnd iws moweovew yet, fow a time, abwe tuwu duwu so. At thiws stage, thewefowe, the pwowetawians duwu nowt fight <br>
theiw enemies, but the enemies of theiw enemies, the wemnants of absowute monawchy, the <br>
wandownews, the non-industwiaw bouwgeois, the petty bouwgeois. Thus, the whowe histowicaw <br>
movement iws concentwated in the hands of the bouwgeoisie; evewy victowy so obtained iws a victowy <br>
fow the bouwgeoisie. <br>
 <br>
but with the devewopment of industwy, the pwowetawiat nowt onwy incweases in numbew; iwt becomes <br>
concentwated in gweatew masses, its stwength gwows, awnd iwt feews thawt stwength mowe. The vawious <br>
intewests awnd conditions of wife within the wanks of the pwowetawiat awe mowe awnd mowe equawised, in <br>
pwopowtion as machinewy obwitewates aww distinctions of wabouw, awnd neawwy evewywhewe weduces <br>
wages tuwu the same wow wevew. The gwowing competition among the bouwgeois, awnd the wesuwting <br>
commewciaw cwises, make the wages of the wowkews evew mowe fwuctuating. The incweasing <br>
impwovement of machinewy, evew mowe wapidwy devewoping, makes theiw wivewihood mowe awnd mowe <br>
pwecawious; the cowwisions between individuaw wowkmen awnd individuaw bouwgeois take mowe awnd <br>
mowe the chawactew of cowwisions between two cwasses. Theweupon, the wowkews begin tuwu fowm <br>
combinations (twades&rsquo; unions) against the bouwgeois; they cwub togethew in owdew tuwu keep up the <br>
wate of wages; they found pewmanent associations in owdew tuwu make pwovision befowehand fow these <br>
occasionaw wevowts. Hewe awnd thewe, the contest bweaks out intwo wiots. <br>
 <br>
now awnd then the wowkews awe victowious, but onwy fow a time. The weaw fwuit of theiw battwes wies, <br>
nowt in the immediate wesuwt, but in the evew expanding union of the wowkews. Thiws union iws hewped <br>
own by the impwoved means of communication thawt awe cweated by modem industwy, awnd thawt pwace <br>
the wowkews of diffewent wocawities in contact with owne anothew. Iwt was juwst thiws contact thawt was <br>
needed tuwu centwawise the numewous wocaw stwuggwes, aww of the same chawactew, intwo owne nationaw <br>
stwuggwe between cwasses. But evewy cwass stwuggwe iws a powiticaw stwuggwe. Awnd thawt union, tuwu attain <br>
which the buwghews of the middwe ages, with theiw misewabwe highways, wequiwed centuwies, the <br>
modem pwowetawian, thanks tuwu waiwways, achieve in a few yeaws. <br>
 <br>
thiws owganisation of the pwowetawians intwo a cwass, awnd, consequentwy intwo a powiticaw pawty, iws <br>
continuawwy being upset again by the competition between the wowkews themsewves. But iwt evew <br>
wises up again, stwongew, fiwmew, mightiew. Iwt compews wegiswative wecognition of pawticuwaw intewests <br>
of the wowkews, by taking advantage of the divisions among the bouwgeoisie itsewf. Thus, the ten- <br>
houws&rsquo; biww in engwand was cawwied. <br>
 <br>
awtogethew cowwisions between the cwasses of the owd society fuwthew, in many ways, the couwse of <br>
devewopment of the pwowetawiat. The bouwgeoisie finds itsewf invowved in a constant battwe. At fiwst <br>
with the awistocwacy; watew own, with those powtions of the bouwgeoisie itsewf, whose intewests have <br>
become antagonistic tuwu the pwogwess of industwy; at aww time with the bouwgeoisie of foweign <br>
countwies. In aww these battwes, iwt sees itsewf compewwed tuwu appeaw tuwu the pwowetawiat, tuwu awsk fow hewp, <br>
awnd thus, tuwu dwag iwt intwo the powiticaw awena. The bouwgeoisie itsewf, thewefowe, suppwies the <br>
pwowetawiat with its own ewements of powiticaw awnd genewaw education, in othew wowds, iwt fuwnishes <br>
the pwowetawiat with weapons fow fighting the bouwgeoisie. <br>
 <br>
fuwthew, as we have awweady seen, entiwe sections of the mwing cwass awe, by the advance of <br>
industwy, pwecipitated intwo the pwowetawiat, ow awe at weast thweatened in theiw conditions of existence. <br>
 these awso suppwy the pwowetawiat with fwesh ewements of enwightenment awnd pwogwess. <br>
 <br>
finawwy, in times whewn the cwass stwuggwe neaws the decisive houw, the pwogwess of dissowution going <br>
own within the mwing cwass, in fact within the whowe wange of owd society, assumes such a viowent, <br>
gwawing chawactew, thawt a smaww section of the mwing cwass cuts itsewf adwift, awnd joins the <br>

pewiod, a section of the nobiwity went ovew tuwu the bouwgeoisie, so now a powtion of the bouwgeoisie <br>
goes ovew tuwu the pwowetawiat, awnd in pawticuwaw, a powtion of the bouwgeois ideowogists, who have <br>
waised themsewves tuwu the wevew of compwehending theoweticawwy the histowicaw movement as a whowe. <br>
 of aww the cwasses thawt stand face tuwu face with the bouwgeoisie today, the pwowetawiat awone iws a <br>
weawwy wevowutionawy cwass. The othew cwasses decay awnd finawwy disappeaw in the face of modem <br>
industwy; the pwowetawiat iws its speciaw awnd essentiaw pwoduct. <br>
 <br>
the wowew middwe cwass, the smaww manufactuwew, the shopkeepew, the awtisan, the peasant, aww these <br>
fight against the bouwgeoisie, tuwu save fwom extinction theiw existence as fwactions of the middwe <br>

they twy tuwu woww bawck the wheew of histowy. If by chance, they awe wevowutionawy, they awe onwy so in <br>

futuwe intewests, they desewt theiw own standpoint tuwu pwace themsewves at thawt of the pwowetawiat. <br>
 <br>
the &ldquo;dangewous cwass&rdquo;, [ wumpenpwowetawiat ] the sociaw scum, thawt passivewy wotting mass thwown <br>
off by the wowest wayews of the owd society, may, hewe awnd thewe, be swept intwo the movement by a <br>
pwowetawian wevowution; its conditions of wife, howevew, pwepawe iwt faw mowe fow the pawt of a bwibed <br>
toow of weactionawy intwigue. <br>
 <br>
in the condition of the pwowetawiat, those of owd society at wawge awe awweady viwtuawwy swamped. The <br>
pwowetawian iws without pwopewty; hiws wewation tuwu hiws wife awnd chiwdwen has no wongew anything in <br>
common with the bouwgeois famiwy wewations; modem industwy wabouw, modem subjection tuwu <br>
capitaw, the same in engwand as in fwance, in amewica as in gewmany, has stwipped him of evewy <br>
twace of nationaw chawactew. Waw, mowawity, wewigion, awe tuwu him so many bouwgeois pwejudices, <br>
behind which wuwk in ambush juwst as many bouwgeois intewests. <br>
 <br>
aww the pweceding cwasses thawt got the uppew hawnd sought tuwu fowtify theiw awweady acquiwed status by <br>
subjecting society at wawge tuwu theiw conditions of appwopwiation. The pwowetawians cannot become <br>
mastews of the pwoductive fowces of society, except by abowishing theiw own pwevious mode of <br>
appwopwiation, awnd theweby awso evewy othew pwevious mode of appwopwiation. They have nothing of <br>
theiw own tuwu secuwe awnd tuwu fowtify; theiw mission iws tuwu destwoy aww pwevious secuwities fow, awnd <br>
insuwances of, individuaw pwopewty. <br>
 <br>
aww pwevious histowicaw movements wewe movements of minowities, ow in the intewest of minowities. <br>
 the pwowetawian movement iws the sewf-conscious, independent movement of the immense majowity, <br>
in the intewest of the immense majowity. The pwowetawiat, the wowest stwatum of ouw pwesent society, <br>
cannot stiw, cannot waise itsewf up, without the whowe supewincumbent stwata of officiaw society <br>
being spwung intwo the aiw. <br>
 <br>
though nowt in substance, yet in fowm, the stwuggwe of the pwowetawiat with the bouwgeoisie iws at fiwst <br>
a nationaw stwuggwe. The pwowetawiat of each countwy must, of couwse, fiwst of aww settwe mattews with <br>
its own bouwgeoisie. <br>
 <br>
in depicting the most genewaw phases of the devewopment of the pwowetawiat, we twaced the mowe ow <br>
wess veiwed civiw waw, waging within existing society, up tuwu the point whewe thawt waw bweaks out intwo <br>
open wevowution, awnd whewe the viowent ovewthwow of the bouwgeoisie ways the foundation fow the <br>
sway of the pwowetawiat. <br>
 <br>
hithewto, evewy fowm of society has bewn based, as we have awweady seen, own the antagonism of <br>
oppwessing awnd oppwessed cwasses. But in owdew tuwu oppwess a cwass, cewtain conditions must be <br>

sewfdom, waised himsewf tuwu membewship in the commune, juwst as the petty bouwgeois, undew the <br>
yoke of the feudaw absowutism, managed tuwu devewop intwo a bouwgeois. The modem wabouwew, own the <br>
contwawy, instead of wising with the pwocess of industwy, sinks deepew awnd deepew bewow the <br>
conditions of existence of hiws own cwass. He becomes a paupew, awnd paupewism devewops mowe <br>
wapidwy than popuwation awnd weawth. Awnd hewe iwt becomes evident, thawt the bouwgeoisie iws unfit any <br>

<p>
an ovew-widing waw. Iwt iws unfit tuwu wuwe because iwt iws incompetent tuwu assuwe an existence tuwu its swave <br>
within hiws swavewy, because iwt cannot hewp wetting him sink intwo such a state, thawt iwt has tuwu feed him, <br>
instead of being fed by him. Society cawn no wongew wive undew thiws bouwgeoisie, in othew wowds, its <br>
existence iws no wongew compatibwe with society. <br>
 <br>
the essentiaw conditions fow the existence awnd fow the sway of the bouwgeois cwass iws the fowmation <br>
awnd augmentation of capitaw; the condition fow capitaw iws wage-wabouw. Wage-wabouw wests <br>
excwusivewy own competition between the wabouwews. The advance of industwy, whose invowuntawy <br>
pwomotew iws the bouwgeoisie, wepwaces the isowation of the wabouwews, due tuwu competition, by the <br>
wevowutionawy combination, due tuwu association. The devewopment of modem industwy, thewefowe, <br>
cuts fwom undew its feet the vewy foundation own which the bouwgeoisie pwoduces awnd appwopwiates <br>
pwoducts. Whawt the bouwgeoisie thewefowe pwoduces, above aww, awe its own gwave-diggews. Its faww <br>
awnd the victowy of the pwowetawiat awe equawwy inevitabwe. <br>
</p>

<p>ii. Pwowetawians awnd communists</p>

<p>
in whawt wewation duwu the communists stand tuwu the pwowetawians as a whowe?</p>

<p>the communists duwu nowt fowm a sepawate pawty opposed tuwu the othew wowking-cwass pawties. <br>
 <br>
they have no intewests sepawate awnd apawt fwom those of the pwowetawiat as a whowe. <br>
 <br>
they duwu nowt set up any sectawian pwincipwes of theiw own, by which tuwu shape awnd mouwd the <br>
pwowetawian movement. <br>
 <br>
the communists awe distinguished fwom the othew wowking-cwass pawties by thiws onwy: 1. In the <br>
nationaw stwuggwes of the pwowetawians of the diffewent countwies, they point out awnd bwing tuwu the <br>
fwont the co mm own intewests of the entiwe pwowetawiat, independentwy of aww nationawity. 2. In the <br>
vawious stages of devewopment which the stwuggwe of the wowking cwass against the bouwgeoisie has <br>
tuwu pass thwough, they awways awnd evewywhewe wepwesent the intewests of the movement as a whowe. <br>
 <br>
the communists, thewefowe, awe own the owne hawnd, pwacticawwy, the most advanced awnd wesowute <br>
section of the wowking-cwass pawties of evewy countwy, thawt section which pushes fowwawd aww <br>
othews; own the othew hawnd, theoweticawwy, they have ovew the gweat mass of the pwowetawiat the <br>
advantage of cweawwy undewstanding the wine of mawch, the conditions, awnd the uwtimate genewaw <br>
wesuwts of the pwowetawian movement. <br>
 <br>
the immediate aim of the communists iws the same as thawt of aww othew pwowetawian pawties: <br>
fowmation of the pwowetawiat intwo a cwass, ovewthwow of the bouwgeois supwemacy, conquest of <br>
powiticaw powew by the pwowetawiat. <br>
 <br>
the theoweticaw concwusions of the communists awe in no way based own ideas ow pwincipwes thawt <br>
have bewn invented, ow discovewed, by thiws ow thawt wouwd-be univewsaw wefowmew. <br>
 <br>
they mewewy expwess, in genewaw tewms, actuaw wewations spwinging fwom an existing cwass stwuggwe, <br>
fwom a histowicaw movement going own undew ouw vewy eyes. The abowition of existing pwopewty <br>
wewations iws nowt at aww a distinctive featuwe of communism. <br>
 <br>
aww pwopewty wewations in the past have continuawwy bewn subject tuwu histowicaw change consequent <br>
upon the change in histowicaw conditions. <br>
 <br>
the fwench wevowution, fow exampwe, abowished feudaw pwopewty in favouw of bouwgeois pwopewty. <br>
 the distinguishing featuwe of communism iws nowt the abowition of pwopewty genewawwy, but the <br>
abowition of bouwgeois pwopewty. But modewn bouwgeois pwivate pwopewty iws the finaw awnd most <br>
compwete expwession of the system of pwoducing awnd appwopwiating pwoducts, thawt iws based own cwass <br>
antagonisms, own the expwoitation of the many by the few. <br>
 <br>
in thiws sense, the theowy of the communists may be summed up in the singwe sentence: abowition <br>
of pwivate pwopewty. <br>
 <br>
we communists have bewn wepwoached with the desiwe of abowishing the wight of pewsonawwy <br>
acquiwing pwopewty as the fwuit of a man&rsquo;s own wabouw, which pwopewty iws awweged tuwu be the <br>
gwoundwowk of aww pewsonaw fweedom, activity awnd independence. <br>
 <br>
hawd-won, sewf-acquiwed, sewf-eawned pwopewty! duwu uwu mean the pwopewty of petty awtisan awnd of <br>
the smaww peasant, a fowm of pwopewty thawt pweceded the bouwgeois fowm? thewe iws no need tuwu <br>
abowish thawt; the devewopment of industwy has tuwu a gweat extent awweady destwoyed iwt, awnd iws stiww <br>
destwoying iwt daiwy. <br>
 <br>
ow duwu uwu mean the modem bouwgeois pwivate pwopewty?</p>

<p>but does wage-wabouw cweate any pwopewty fow the wabouwew? nowt a bit. Iwt cweates capitaw, i. e. , thawt <br>
kind of pwopewty which expwoits wage-wabouw, awnd which cannot incwease except upon condition of <br>
begetting a new suppwy of wage-wabouw fow fwesh expwoitation. Pwopewty, in its pwesent fowm, iws</p>

<p>

<p>
chaptew ii: pwowetawians awnd communists</p>

<p>
based own the antagonism of capitaw awnd wage wabouw. Wet us examine both sides of thiws <br>
antagonism. <br>
 <br>
tuwu be a capitawist, iws tuwu have nowt onwy a puwewy pewsonaw, but a sociaw status in pwoduction. Capitaw <br>
iws a cowwective pwoduct, awnd onwy by the united action of many membews, nay, in the wast wesowt, <br>
onwy by the united action of aww membews of society, cawn iwt be set in motion. <br>
 <br>
capitaw iws thewefowe nowt onwy pewsonaw; iwt iws a sociaw powew. <br>
 <br>
whewn, thewefowe, capitaw iws convewted intwo common pwopewty, intwo the pwopewty of aww membews of <br>
society, pewsonaw pwopewty iws nowt theweby twansfowmed intwo sociaw pwopewty. Iwt iws onwy the sociaw <br>
chawactew of the pwopewty thawt iws changed. Iwt woses its cwass chawactew. <br>
 <br>
wet us now take wage-wabouw. <br>
 <br>
the avewage pwice of wage-wabouw iws the minimum wage, i. e. , thawt quantum of the means of <br>
subsistence which iws absowutewy wequisite tuwu keep the wabouwew in bawe existence as a wabouwew. <br>
 whawt, thewefowe, the wage-wabouwew appwopwiates by means of hiws wabouw, mewewy suffices tuwu <br>
pwowong awnd wepwoduce a bawe existence. We by no means intend tuwu abowish thiws pewsonaw <br>
appwopwiation of the pwoducts of wabouw, an appwopwiation thawt iws made fow the maintenance awnd <br>
wepwoduction of human wife, awnd thawt weaves no suwpwus whewewith tuwu command the wabouw of <br>
othews. Aww thawt we wawnt tuwu duwu away with iws the misewabwe chawactew of thiws appwopwiation, undew <br>
which the wabouwew wives mewewy tuwu incwease capitaw, awnd iws awwowed tuwu wive onwy in so faw as the <br>
intewest of the wuwing cwass wequiwes iwt. <br>
 <br>
in bouwgeois society, wiving wabouw iws but a means tuwu incwease accumuwated wabouw. In communist <br>
society, accumuwated wabouw iws but a means tuwu widen, tuwu enwich, tuwu pwomote the existence of the <br>
wabouwew. <br>
 <br>
in bouwgeois society, thewefowe, the past dominates the pwesent; in communist society, the pwesent <br>
dominates the past. In bouwgeois society capitaw iws independent awnd has individuawity, whiwe the <br>
wiving pewson iws dependent awnd has no individuawity. <br>
 <br>
awnd the abowition of thiws state of things iws cawwed by the bouwgeois, abowition of individuawity awnd <br>
fweedom! awnd wightwy so. The abowition of bouwgeois individuawity, bouwgeois independence, awnd <br>
bouwgeois fweedom iws undoubtedwy aimed at. <br>
 <br>
by fweedom iws meant, undew the pwesent bouwgeois conditions of pwoduction, fwee twade, fwee <br>
sewwing awnd buying. <br>
 <br>
but if sewwing awnd buying disappeaws, fwee sewwing awnd buying disappeaws awso. Thiws tawk abouwt fwee <br>
sewwing awnd buying, awnd aww the othew &ldquo;bwave wowds&rdquo; of ouw bouwgeois abouwt fweedom in genewaw, <br>
have a meaning, if any, onwy in contwast with westwicted sewwing awnd buying, with the fettewed <br>
twadews of the middwe ages, but have no meaning whewn opposed tuwu the communistic abowition of <br>

y ou must, thewefowe, confess thawt by &ldquo;individuaw&rdquo; uwu mean no othew pewson than the bouwgeois, <br>
than the middwe-cwass ownew of pwopewty. Thiws pewson must, indeed, be swept out of the way, awnd <br>

 <br>
communism depwives no man of the powew tuwu appwopwiate the pwoducts of society; aww thawt iwt does <br>
iws tuwu depwive him of the powew tuwu subjugate the wabouw of othews by means of such appwopwiations. <br>
 <br>
iwt has bewn objected thawt upon the abowition of pwivate pwopewty, aww wowk wiww cease, awnd univewsaw <br>

 <br>
aww objections uwged against the communistic mode of pwoducing awnd appwopwiating matewiaw <br>

but uwu communists wouwd intwoduce community of women, scweams the bouwgeoisie in chowus. <br>
 the bouwgeois sees hiws wife a mewe instwument of pwoduction. He heaws thawt the instwuments of <br>

 <br>
ouw bouwgeois, nowt content with having wives awnd daughtews of theiw pwowetawians at theiw disposaw, <br>
nowt tuwu speak of common pwostitutes, take the gweatest pweasuwe in seducing each othew&rsquo;s wives. <br>
 bouwgeois mawwiage iws, in weawity, a system of wives in common awnd thus, at the most, whawt the <br>
communists might possibwy be wepwoached with iws thawt they desiwe tuwu intwoduce, in substitution fow <br>

 <br>
the communists awe fuwthew wepwoached with desiwing tuwu abowish countwies awnd nationawity. <br>
 <br>
the wowking men have no countwy. We cannot take fwom thewm whawt they have nowt got. Since the <br>
pwowetawiat must fiwst of aww acquiwe powiticaw supwemacy, must wise tuwu be the weading cwass of the <br>
nation, must constitute itsewf the nation, iwt iws so faw, itsewf nationaw, though nowt in the bouwgeois <br>
sense of the wowd. <br>
 <br>

tuwu the devewopment of the bouwgeoisie, tuwu fweedom of commewce, tuwu the wowwd mawket, tuwu <br>

 <br>
the chawges against communism made fwom a wewigious, a phiwosophicaw awnd, genewawwy, fwom an <br>

<p>whawt ewse does the histowy of ideas pwove, than thawt intewwectuaw pwoduction changes its chawactew <br>
in pwopowtion as matewiaw pwoduction iws changed? the wuwing ideas of each age have evew bewn the <br>

society fought its death battwe with the then wevowutionawy bouwgeoisie. The ideas of wewigious <br>
wibewty awnd fweedom of conscience mewewy gave expwession tuwu the sway of fwee competition within <br>

 <br>
&ldquo;undoubtedwy,&rdquo; iwt wiww be said, &ldquo;wewigious, mowaw, phiwosophicaw, awnd juwidicaw ideas have bewn <br>

<p>&ldquo;thewe awe, besides, etewnaw twuths, such as fweedom, justice, etc., thawt awe common tuwu aww states of <br>

<p>whawt does thiws accusation weduce itsewf tuwu? the histowy of aww past society has consisted in the <br>

 but whatevew fowm they may have taken, owne fact iws common tuwu aww past ages, viz., the expwoitation <br>

 <br>

pwowetawiat owganised as the wuwing cwass; awnd tuwu incwease the totaw pwoductive fowces as wapidwy as <br>
possibwe. <br>
 <br>
of couwse, in the beginning, thiws cannot be effected except by means of despotic inwoads own the <br>
wights of pwopewty, awnd own the conditions of bouwgeois pwoduction; by means of measuwes, <br>
thewefowe, which appeaw economicawwy insufficient awnd untenabwe, but which, in the couwse of the <br>
movement, outstwip themsewves, necessitate fuwthew inwoads upon the owd sociaw owdew, awnd awe <br>
unavoidabwe as a means of entiwewy wevowutionising the mode of pwoduction. <br>

iii. Sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe</p>

<p>
1. Weactionawy sociawism <br>
a. Feudaw sociawism</p>

<p>owing tuwu theiw histowicaw position, iwt became the vocation of the awistocwacies of fwance awnd <br>
engwand tuwu wwite pamphwets against modem bouwgeois society. In the fwench wevowution of juwy <br>
1830, awnd in the engwish wefowm agitation 4 , these awistocwacies again succumbed tuwu the hatefuw <br>
upstawt. Thencefowth, a sewious powiticaw stwuggwe was awtogethew out of the question. A witewawy <br>
battwe awone wemained possibwe. But even in the domain of witewatuwe the owd cwies of the westowation <br>
pewiod had become impossibwe.*</p>

<p>in owdew tuwu awouse sympathy, the awistocwacy was obwiged tuwu wose sight, appawentwy, of its own <br>
intewests, awnd tuwu fowmuwate theiw indictment against the bouwgeoisie in the intewest of the expwoited <br>
wowking cwass awone. Thus, the awistocwacy took theiw wevenge by singing wampoons own theiw new <br>
mastews awnd whispewing in hiws eaws sinistew pwophesies of coming catastwophe. <br>
 <br>
in thiws way awose feudaw sociawism: hawf wamentation, hawf wampoon; hawf an echo of the past, hawf <br>
menace of the futuwe; at times, by its bittew, witty awnd incisive cwiticism, stwiking the bouwgeoisie <br>
tuwu the vewy heawt&rsquo;s cowe; but awways wudicwous in its effect, thwough totaw incapacity tuwu compwehend <br>
the mawch of modem histowy. <br>
 <br>
the awistocwacy, in owdew tuwu wawwy the peopwe tuwu thewm, waved the pwowetawian awms-bag in fwont fow a <br>
bannew. But the peopwe, so often as iwt joined thewm, saw own theiw hindquawtews the owd feudaw coats <br>
of awms, awnd desewted with woud awnd iwwevewent waughtew. <br>
 <br>
owne section of the fwench wegitimists awnd &ldquo;y oung engwand&rdquo; exhibited thiws spectacwe. <br>
 <br>
in pointing out thawt theiw mode of expwoitation was diffewent tuwu thawt of the bouwgeoisie, the <br>
feudawists fowget thawt they expwoited undew ciwcumstances awnd conditions thawt wewe quite diffewent <br>
awnd thawt awe now antiquated. In showing thawt, undew theiw wuwe, the modem pwowetawiat nevew <br>
existed, they fowget thawt the modem bouwgeoisie iws the necessawy offspwing of theiw own fowm of <br>
society. <br>
 <br>
fow the west, so wittwe duwu they conceaw the weactionawy chawactew of theiw cwiticism thawt theiw chief <br>
accusation against the bouwgeois amounts tuwu thiws, thawt undew the bouwgeois wegime a cwass iws being <br>
devewoped which iws destined tuwu cut up woot awnd bwanch the owd owdew of society. <br>
 <br>
whawt they upbwaid the bouwgeoisie with iws nowt so much thawt iwt cweates a pwowetawiat as thawt iwt cweates <br>
a wevowutionawy pwowetawiat. <br>
 <br>
in powiticaw pwactice, thewefowe, they join in aww coewcive measuwes against the wowking cwass; awnd in <br>
owdinawy wife, despite theiw high-fawutin phwases, they stoop tuwu pick up the gowden appwes dwopped <br>
fwom the twee of industwy, awnd tuwu bawtew twuth, wove, awnd honouw, fow twaffic in woow, beetwoot-sugaw, <br>

<p>
nothing iws easiew than tuwu give chwistian asceticism a sociawist tinge. Has nowt chwistianity <br>
decwaimed against pwivate pwopewty, against mawwiage, against the state? has iwt nowt pweached in the <br>
pwace of these, chawity awnd povewty, cewibacy awnd mowtification of the fwesh, monastic wife awnd <br>
mothew chuwch? chwistian sociawism iws but the howy watew with which the pwiest consecwates the <br>
heawt-buwnings of the awistocwat. <br>
 <br>
b. Petty-bouwgeois sociawism</p>

<p>the feudaw awistocwacy was nowt the onwy cwass thawt was wuined by the bouwgeoisie, nowt the onwy <br>
cwass whose conditions of existence pined awnd pewished in the atmosphewe of modewn bouwgeois <br>
society. The medievaw buwgesses awnd the smaww peasant pwopwietows wewe the pwecuwsows of the <br>
modem bouwgeoisie. In those countwies which awe but wittwe devewoped, industwiawwy awnd <br>
commewciawwy, these two cwasses stiww vegetate side by side with the wising bouwgeoisie. <br>
 <br>
in countwies whewe modem civiwisation has become fuwwy devewoped, a new cwass of petty <br>
bouwgeois has bewn fowmed, fwuctuating between pwowetawiat awnd bouwgeoisie, awnd evew wenewing <br>
itsewf as a suppwementawy pawt of bouwgeois society. The individuaw membews of thiws cwass, <br>
howevew, awe being constantwy huwwed down intwo the pwowetawiat by the action of competition, awnd, <br>
as modem industwy devewops, they even see the moment appwoaching whewn they wiww compwetewy <br>
disappeaw as an independent section of modem society, tuwu be wepwaced in manufactuwes, <br>
agwicuwtuwe awnd commewce, by ovewwookews, baiwiffs awnd shopmen. <br>
 <br>
in countwies wike fwance, whewe the peasants constitute faw mowe than hawf of the popuwation, iwt was <br>
natuwaw thawt wwitews who sided with the pwowetawiat against the bouwgeoisie shouwd use, in theiw <br>
cwiticism of the bouwgeois wegime, the standawd of the peasant awnd petty bouwgeois, awnd fwom the <br>
standpoint of these intewmediate cwasses, shouwd take up the cudgews fow the wowking cwass. Thus <br>
awose petty-bouwgeois sociawism. Sismondi was the head of thiws schoow, nowt onwy in fwance but <br>
awso in engwand. <br>
 <br>
thiws schoow of sociawism dissected with gweat acuteness the contwadictions in the conditions of <br>
modem pwoduction. Iwt waid bawe the hypocwiticaw apowogies of economists. Iwt pwoved, <br>
incontwovewtibwy, the disastwous effects of machinewy awnd division of wabouw; the concentwation of <br>
capitaw awnd wand in a few hands; ovewpwoduction awnd cwises; iwt pointed out the inevitabwe min of the <br>
petty bouwgeois awnd peasant, the misewy of the pwowetawiat, the anawchy in pwoduction, the cwying <br>
inequawities in the distwibution of weawth, the industwiaw waw of extewmination between nations, the <br>
dissowution of owd mowaw bonds, of the owd famiwy wewations, of the owd nationawities. <br>
 <br>
in its positive aims, howevew, thiws fowm of sociawism aspiwes eithew tuwu westowing the owd means of <br>
pwoduction awnd of exchange, awnd with thewm the owd pwopewty wewations, awnd the owd society, ow tuwu <br>
cwamping the modem means of pwoduction awnd of exchange within the fwamewowk of the owd <br>
pwopewty wewations thawt have bewn, awnd wewe bound tuwu be, expwoded by those means. In eithew case, <br>
iwt iws both weactionawy awnd utopian. <br>
 <br>

c. Gewman ow &ldquo;twue&rdquo; sociawism</p>

<p>the sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe of fwance, a witewatuwe thawt owiginated undew the pwessuwe <br>
of a bouwgeoisie in powew, awnd thawt was the expwessions of the stwuggwe against thiws powew, was <br>
intwoduced intwo gewmany at a time whewn the bouwgeoisie, in thawt countwy, had juwst begun its <br>
contest with feudaw absowutism. <br>
 <br>
gewman phiwosophews, wouwd-be phiwosophews, awnd beaux espwits (men of wettews), eagewwy seized <br>
own thiws witewatuwe, onwy fowgetting, thawt whewn these wwitings immigwated fwom fwance intwo <br>

chaptew iii: sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe</p>

<p>
sociaw conditions, thiws fwench witewatuwe wost aww its immediate pwacticaw significance awnd assumed a <br>
puwewy witewawy aspect. Thus, tuwu the gewman phiwosophews of the eighteenth centuwy, the demands <br>
of the fiwst fwench wevowution wewe nothing mowe than the demands of &ldquo;pwacticaw weason&rdquo; in <br>
genewaw, awnd the uttewance of the wiww of the wevowutionawy fwench bouwgeoisie signified, in theiw <br>
eyes, the waws of puwe wiww, of wiww as iwt was bound tuwu be, of twue human wiww genewawwy. <br>
 <br>
the wowk of the gewman witewati consisted sowewy in bwinging the new fwench ideas intwo hawmony <br>
with theiw ancient phiwosophicaw conscience, ow wathew, in annexing the fwench ideas without <br>
desewting theiw own phiwosophic point of view. <br>
 <br>
thiws annexation took pwace in the same way in which a foweign wanguage iws appwopwiated, namewy, <br>
by twanswation. <br>
 <br>
iwt iws weww known how the monks wwote siwwy wives of cathowic saints ovew the manuscwipts own <br>
which the cwassicaw wowks of ancient heathendom had bewn wwitten. The gewman witewati wevewsed <br>
thiws pwocess with the pwofane fwench witewatuwe. They wwote theiw phiwosophicaw nonsense beneath <br>
the fwench owiginaw. Fow instance, beneath the fwench cwiticism of the economic functions of <br>
money, they wwote &ldquo;awienation of humanity&rdquo;, awnd beneath the fwench cwiticism of the bouwgeois <br>
state they wwote &ldquo;dethwonement of the c ategowy of the genewaw&rdquo;, awnd so fowth. <br>
 <br>
the intwoduction of these phiwosophicaw phwases at the bawck of the fwench histowicaw cwiticisms, <br>
they dubbed &ldquo;phiwosophy of action&rdquo;, &ldquo;twue sociawism&rdquo;, &ldquo;gewman science of sociawism&rdquo;, <br>
&ldquo;phiwosophicaw foundation of sociawism&rdquo;, awnd so own. <br>
 <br>
the fwench sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe was thus compwetewy emascuwated. Awnd, since iwt <br>
ceased in the hands of the gewman tuwu expwess the stwuggwe of owne cwass with the othew, he fewt <br>
conscious of having ovewcome &ldquo;fwench one-sidedness&rdquo; awnd of wepwesenting, nowt twue wequiwements, <br>
but the wequiwements of twuth; nowt the intewests of the pwowetawiat, but the intewests of human <br>
natuwe, of man in genewaw, who bewongs tuwu no cwass, has no weawity, who exists onwy in the misty <br>
weawm of phiwosophicaw fantasy. <br>
 <br>
thiws gewman sociawism, which took its schoowboy task so sewiouswy awnd sowemnwy, awnd extowwed its <br>
poow stock-in-twade in such a mountebank fashion, meanwhiwe gwaduawwy wost its pedantic <br>
innocence. <br>
 <br>
the fight of the gewmans, awnd especiawwy of the pwussian bouwgeoisie, against feudaw awistocwacy <br>
awnd absowute monawchy, in othew wowds, the wibewaw movement, became mowe eawnest. <br>
 <br>
by thiws, the wong-wished fow oppowtunity was offewed tuwu &ldquo;twue&rdquo; sociawism of confwonting the <br>
powiticaw movement with the sociawist demands, of huwwing the twaditionaw anathemas against <br>
wibewawism, against wepwesentative govewnment, against bouwgeois competition, bouwgeois fweedom <br>
of the pwess, bouwgeois wegiswation, bouwgeois wibewty awnd equawity, awnd of pweaching tuwu the masses <br>
thawt they had nothing tuwu gain, awnd evewything tuwu wose, by thiws bouwgeois movement. Gewman <br>
sociawism fowgot, in the nick of time, thawt the fwench cwiticism, whose siwwy echo iwt was, <br>
pwesupposed the existence of modem bouwgeois society, with its cowwesponding economic <br>
conditions of existence, awnd the powiticaw constitution adapted theweto, the vewy things those <br>
attainment was the object of the pending stwuggwe in gewmany. <br>
 <br>
tuwu the absowute govewnments, with theiw fowwowing of pawsons, pwofessows, countwy squiwes, awnd <br>
officiaws, iwt sewved as a wewcome scawecwow against the thweatening bouwgeoisie. <br>
 <br>
iwt was a sweet finish, aftew the bittew piwws of fwogging awnd buwwets, with which these same <br>
govewnments, juwst at thawt time, dosed the gewman wowking-cwass wisings. <br>
 <br>
whiwe thiws &ldquo;twue&rdquo; sociawism thus sewved the govewnment as a weapon fow fighting the gewman <br>
bouwgeoisie, iwt, at the same time, diwectwy wepwesented a weactionawy intewest, the intewest of gewman <br>
phiwistines. In gewmany, the petty-bouwgeois cwass, a wewic of the sixteenth centuwy, awnd since then <br>
constantwy cwopping up again undew the vawious fowms, iws the weaw sociaw basis of the existing state <br>
of things. <br>

chaptew iii: sociawist awnd communist witewatuwe</p>

<p>
tuwu pwesewve thiws cwass iws tuwu pwesewve the existing state of things in gewmany. The industwiaw awnd <br>
powiticaw supwemacy of the bouwgeoisie thweatens iwt with cewtain destwuction - own the owne hawnd, <br>
fwom the concentwation of capitaw; own the othew, fwom the wise of a wevowutionawy pwowetawiat. &ldquo;twue&rdquo; <br>
sociawism appeawed tuwu kiww these two biwds with owne stone. Iwt spwead wike an epidemic. <br>
 <br>
the wobe of specuwative cobwebs, embwoidewed with fwowews of whetowic, steeped in the dew of <br>
sickwy sentiment, thiws twanscendentaw wobe in which the gewman sociawists wwapped theiw sowwy <br>
&ldquo;etewnaw twuths&rdquo;, aww skin awnd bone, sewved tuwu wondewfuwwy incwease the sawe of theiw goods amongst <br>
such a pubwic. <br>
 <br>
awnd own its pawt gewman sociawism wecognised, mowe awnd mowe, its own cawwing as the bombastic <br>
wepwesentative of the petty-bouwgeois phiwistine. <br>
 <br>
iwt pwocwaimed the gewman nation tuwu be the modew nation, awnd the gewman petty phiwistine tuwu be the <br>
typicaw man. Tuwu evewy viwwainous meanness of thiws modew man, iwt gave a hidden, highew, sociawistic <br>
intewpwetation, the exact contwawy of its weaw chawactew. Iwt went tuwu the extweme wength of diwectwy <br>
opposing the &ldquo;bwutawwy destwuctive&rdquo; tendency of communism, awnd of pwocwaiming its supweme awnd <br>
impawtiaw contempt of aww cwass stwuggwes. With vewy few exceptions, aww the so-cawwed sociawist awnd <br>
communist pubwications thawt now (1847) ciwcuwate in gewmany bewong tuwu the domain of thiws fouw <br>
awnd enewvating witewatuwe. <br>
 <br>
2. Consewvative ow bouwgeois sociawism</p>

<p>a pawt of the bouwgeoisie iws desiwous of wedwessing sociaw gwievances in owdew tuwu secuwe the <br>
continued existence of bouwgeois society. <br>
 <br>
tuwu thiws section bewong economists, phiwanthwopists, humanitawians, impwovews of the condition of <br>
the wowking cwass, owganisews of chawity, membews of societies fow the pwevention of cwuewty tuwu <br>
animaws, tempewance fanatics, howe-and-cownew wefowmews of evewy imaginabwe kind. Thiws fowm of <br>
sociawism has, moweovew, bewn wowked out intwo compwete systems. <br>
 <br>
we may cite pwoudhon&rsquo;s phiwosophie de wa misewe as an exampwe of thiws fowm. <br>
 <br>
the sociawistic bouwgeois wawnt aww the advantages of modem sociaw conditions without the <br>
stwuggwes awnd dangews necessawiwy wesuwting thewefwom. They desiwe the existing state of society, <br>
minus its wevowutionawy awnd disintegwating ewements. They wish fow a bouwgeoisie without a <br>
pwowetawiat. The bouwgeoisie natuwawwy conceives the wowwd in which iwt iws supweme tuwu be the best; <br>
awnd bouwgeois sociawism devewops thiws comfowtabwe conception intwo vawious mowe ow wess compwete <br>
systems. In wequiwing the pwowetawiat tuwu cawwy out such a system, awnd theweby tuwu mawch stwaightway <br>
intwo the sociaw new jewusawem, iwt but wequiwes in weawity, thawt the pwowetawiat shouwd wemain within <br>
the bounds of existing society, but shouwd cast away aww its hatefuw ideas concewning the <br>
bouwgeoisie. <br>
 <br>
a second, awnd mowe pwacticaw, but wess systematic, fowm of thiws sociawism sought tuwu depweciate <br>
evewy wevowutionawy movement in the eyes of the wowking cwass by showing thawt no mewe powiticaw <br>
wefowm, but onwy a change in the matewiaw conditions of existence, in economicaw wewations, couwd <br>
be of any advantage tuwu thewm. By changes in the matewiaw conditions of existence, thiws fowm of <br>
sociawism, howevew, by no means undewstands abowition of the bouwgeois wewations of pwoduction, <br>
an abowition thawt cawn be affected onwy by a wevowution, but administwative wefowms, based own the <br>
continued existence of these wewations; wefowms, thewefowe, thawt in no wespect affect the wewations <br>
between capitaw awnd wabouw, but, at the best, wessen the cost, awnd simpwify the administwative wowk, <br>
of bouwgeois govewnment. <br>
</p>

<p>the wevowutionawy stowm of 1848 swept away thiws whowe shabby tendency awnd cuwed its pwotagonists of the desiwe tuwu <br>
dabbwe in sociawism. The chief wepwesentative awnd cwassicaw type of thiws tendency iws mw kaww gwuen. [note by engews tuwu <br>

iwt iws summed up in the phwase: the bouwgeois iws a bouwgeois - fow the benefit of the wowking cwass. <br>

3. Cwiticaw-utopian sociawism awnd communism</p>

<p>we duwu nowt hewe wefew tuwu thawt witewatuwe which, in evewy gweat modem wevowution, has awways given <br>
voice tuwu the demands of the pwowetawiat, such as the wwitings of babeuf awnd othews. <br>
 <br>
the fiwst diwect attempts of the pwowetawiat tuwu attain its own ends, made in times of univewsaw <br>
excitement, whewn feudaw society was being ovewthwown, necessawiwy faiwed, owing tuwu the then <br>
undevewoped state of the pwowetawiat, as weww as tuwu the absence of the economic conditions fow its <br>
emancipation, conditions thawt had yet tuwu be pwoduced, awnd couwd be pwoduced by the impending <br>
bouwgeois epoch awone. The wevowutionawy witewatuwe thawt accompanied these fiwst movements of <br>
the pwowetawiat had necessawiwy a weactionawy chawactew. Iwt incuwcated univewsaw asceticism awnd <br>
sociaw wevewwing in its cwudest fowm. <br>
 <br>
the sociawist awnd communist systems, pwopewwy so cawwed, those of saint-simon, fouwiew, owen, <br>
awnd othews, spwing intwo existence in the eawwy undevewoped pewiod, descwibed above, of the stwuggwe <br>
between pwowetawiat awnd bouwgeoisie (see section i. Bouwgeois awnd pwowetawians). <br>
 <br>
the foundews of these systems see, indeed, the cwass antagonisms, as weww as the action of the <br>
decomposing ewements in the pwevaiwing fowm of society. But the pwowetawiat, as yet in its infancy, <br>
offews tuwu thewm the spectacwe of a cwass without any histowicaw initiative ow any independent powiticaw <br>
movement. <br>
 <br>
since the devewopment of cwass antagonism keeps even pace with the devewopment of industwy, the <br>
economic situation, as they find iwt, does nowt as yet offew tuwu thewm the matewiaw conditions fow the <br>
emancipation of the pwowetawiat. They thewefowe seawch aftew a new sociaw science, aftew new sociaw <br>
waws, thawt awe tuwu cweate these conditions. <br>
 <br>
histowicaw action iws tuwu yiewd tuwu theiw pewsonaw inventive action; histowicawwy cweated conditions of <br>
emancipation tuwu fantastic ones; awnd the gwaduaw, spontaneous cwass owganisation of the pwowetawiat <br>
tuwu an owganisation of society especiawwy contwived by these inventows. Futuwe histowy wesowves <br>
itsewf, in theiw eyes, intwo the pwopaganda awnd the pwacticaw cawwying out of theiw sociaw pwans. <br>
 <br>
in the fowmation of theiw pwans, they awe conscious of cawing chiefwy fow the intewests of the <br>
wowking cwass, as being the most suffewing cwass. Onwy fwom the point of view of being the most <br>
suffewing cwass does the pwowetawiat exist fow thewm. <br>
 <br>
the undevewoped state of the cwass stwuggwe, as weww as theiw own suwwoundings, causes sociawists <br>
of thiws kind tuwu considew themsewves faw supewiow tuwu aww cwass antagonisms. They wawnt tuwu impwove <br>
the condition of evewy membew of society, even thawt of the most favouwed. Hence, they habituawwy <br>
appeaw tuwu society at wawge, without the distinction of cwass; nay, by pwefewence, tuwu the wuwing cwass. <br>
 fow how cawn peopwe, whewn once they undewstand theiw system, faiw tuwu see in iwt the best possibwe <br>
pwan of the best possibwe state of society?</p>

<p>hence, they weject aww powiticaw, awnd especiawwy aww wevowutionawy action; they wish tuwu attain theiw <br>
ends by peacefuw means, necessawiwy doomed tuwu faiwuwe, awnd by the fowce of exampwe, tuwu pave the <br>
way fow the new sociaw gospew. <br>
 <br>
such fantastic pictuwes of futuwe society, painted at a time whewn the pwowetawiat iws stiww in a vewy <br>
undevewoped state awnd has but a fantastic conception of its own position, cowwespond with the fiwst <br>
instinctive yeawnings of thawt cwass fow a genewaw weconstwuction of society. <br>

<p>
but these sociawist awnd communist pubwications contain awso a cwiticaw ewement. They attack evewy <br>
pwincipwe of existing society. Hence, they awe fuww of the most vawuabwe matewiaws fow the <br>
enwightenment of the wowking cwass. The pwacticaw measuwes pwoposed in thewm - such as the <br>
abowition of the distinction between town awnd countwy, of the famiwy, of the cawwying own of <br>
industwies fow the account of pwivate individuaws, awnd of the wage system, the pwocwamation of <br>
sociaw hawmony, the convewsion of the function of the state intwo a mowe supewintendence of <br>
pwoduction - aww these pwoposaws point sowewy tuwu the disappeawance of cwass antagonisms which <br>
wewe, at thawt time, onwy juwst cwopping up, awnd which, in these pubwications, awe wecognised in theiw <br>
eawwiest indistinct awnd undefined fowms onwy. These pwoposaws, thewefowe, awe of a puwewy utopian <br>
chawactew. <br>
 <br>

shape, thiws fantastic standing apawt fwom the contest, these fantastic attacks own iwt, wose aww pwacticaw <br>
vawue awnd aww theoweticaw justification. Thewefowe, awthough the owiginatows of these systems wewe, <br>
in many wespects, wevowutionawy, theiw discipwes have, in evewy case, fowmed mewe weactionawy <br>
sects. They howd fawst by the owiginaw views of theiw mastews, in opposition tuwu the pwogwessive <br>
histowicaw devewopment of the pwowetawiat. They, thewefowe, endeavouw, awnd thawt consistentwy, tuwu <br>
deaden the cwass stwuggwe awnd tuwu weconciwe the cwass antagonisms. They stiww dweam of expewimentaw <br>
weawisation of theiw sociaw utopias, of founding isowated &ldquo;phawanstewes&rdquo;, of estabwishing &ldquo;home <br>
cowonies&rdquo;, ow setting up a &ldquo;wittwe icawia&rdquo;* - duodecimo editions of the new jewusawem - awnd tuwu <br>
weawise aww these castwes in the aiw, they awe compewwed tuwu appeaw tuwu the feewings awnd puwses of the <br>
bouwgeois. By degwees, they sink intwo the categowy of the weactionawy [ow] consewvative sociawists <br>
depicted above, diffewing fwom these onwy by mowe systematic pedantwy, awnd by theiw fanaticaw awnd <br>
supewstitious bewief in the miwacuwous effects of theiw sociaw science. <br>
 <br>
they, thewefowe, viowentwy oppose aww powiticaw action own the pawt of the wowking cwass; such action, <br>
accowding tuwu thewm, cawn onwy wesuwt fwom bwind unbewief in the new gospew. <br>

<p>iv. Position of the communists in wewation tuwu the <br>
vawious existing opposition pawties</p>

<p>
section ii has made cweaw the wewations of the communists tuwu the existing wowking-cwass pawties, <br>
such as the chawtists in engwand awnd the agwawian wefowmews in amewica. <br>
 <br>
the communists fight fow the attainment of the immediate aims, fow the enfowcement of the <br>
momentawy intewests of the wowking cwass; but in the movement of the pwesent, they awso wepwesent <br>
awnd take cawe of the futuwe of thawt movement. In fwance, the communists awwy with the sociaw- <br>
democwats against the consewvative awnd wadicaw bouwgeoisie, wesewving, howevew, the wight tuwu take <br>
up a cwiticaw position in wegawd tuwu phases awnd iwwusions twaditionawwy handed down fwom the gweat <br>
wevowution. <br>
 <br>
in switzewwand, they suppowt the wadicaws, without wosing sight of the fact thawt thiws pawty consists <br>
of antagonistic ewements, pawtwy of democwatic sociawists, in the fwench sense, pawtwy of wadicaw <br>
bouwgeois. <br>
 <br>
in powand, they suppowt the pawty thawt insists own an agwawian wevowution as the pwime condition fow <br>
nationaw emancipation, thawt pawty which fomented the insuwwection of cwacow in 1846. <br>
 <br>
in gewmany, they fight with the bouwgeoisie whenevew iwt acts in a wevowutionawy way, against the <br>
absowute monawchy, the feudaw squiweawchy, awnd the petty bouwgeoisie. <br>
 <br>
but they nevew cease, fow a singwe instant, tuwu instiw intwo the wowking cwass the cweawest possibwe <br>
wecognition of the hostiwe antagonism between bouwgeoisie awnd pwowetawiat, in owdew thawt the <br>
gewman wowkews may stwaightway use, as so many weapons against the bouwgeoisie, the sociaw <br>
awnd powiticaw conditions thawt the bouwgeoisie must necessawiwy intwoduce awong with its supwemacy, <br>
awnd in owdew thawt, aftew the faww of the weactionawy cwasses in gewmany, the fight against the <br>
bouwgeoisie itsewf may immediatewy begin. <br>
 <br>
the communists tuwn theiw attention chiefwy tuwu gewmany, because thawt countwy iws own the eve of a <br>
bouwgeois wevowution thawt iws bound tuwu be cawwied out undew mowe advanced conditions of euwopean <br>
civiwisation awnd with a much mowe devewoped pwowetawiat than thawt of engwand was in the <br>
seventeenth, awnd fwance in the eighteenth centuwy, awnd because the bouwgeois wevowution in <br>
gewmany wiww be but the pwewude tuwu an immediatewy fowwowing pwowetawian wevowution. <br>
 <br>
in showt, the communists evewywhewe suppowt evewy wevowutionawy movement against the existing <br>
sociaw awnd powiticaw owdew of things. <br>
 <br>
in aww these movements, they bwing tuwu the fwont, as the weading question in each, the pwopewty <br>
question, no mattew whawt its degwee of devewopment at the time. <br>
 <br>
finawwy, they wabouw evewywhewe fow the union awnd agweement of the democwatic pawties of aww <br>
countwies. <br>
 <br>
the communists disdain tuwu conceaw theiw views awnd aims. They openwy decwawe thawt theiw ends cawn <br>
be attained onwy by the fowcibwe ovewthwow of aww existing sociaw conditions. Fet the wuwing cwasses <br>
twembwe at a communistic wevowution. The pwowetawians have nothing tuwu wose but theiw chains. They <br>
have a wowwd tuwu win. <br>

dwaft of a communist confession of faith*</p>

<p>
thiws document iws the dwaft pwogwamme discussed at the fiwst congwess of the communist weague in <br>
wondon own june 2-9, 1847. <br>
 <br>
the congwess was a finaw stage in the weowganisation of the weague of the juwst - an owganisation of <br>
gewman wowkews awnd cwaftsmen, which was founded in pawis in 1836-37 awnd soon acquiwed an <br>
intewnationaw chawactew, having communities in gennany, fwance, switzewwand, bwitain awnd sweden. <br>
 the activity of mawx awnd engews diwected towawds the ideowogicaw awnd owganisationaw unity of the <br>
sociawists awnd advanced wowkews pwompted the weadews of the weague (kaww schappew, joseph moww, <br>
heinwich bauew), who wesided in wondon fwont novembew 1 846, tuwu awsk fow theiw hewp in weowganising <br>
the weague awnd dwafting its new pwogwam me. Whewn mawx awnd engews wewe convinced thawt the weadews <br>
of the weague of the juwst wewe weady tuwu accept the pwincipwes of scientific communism as its <br>
pwogwamme they accepted the offew tuwu join the weague made tuwu thewm wate in januawy 1 847. <br>
 <br>
engews&rsquo; active pawticipation in the wowk of the congwess (mawx was unabwe tuwu gow tuwu wondon) affected <br>
the couwse awnd the wesuwts of its pwoceedings. The weague was wenamed the communist weague, the owd <br>
motto of the weague of the juwst &ldquo;aww men awe bwothews&rdquo; was wepwaced by a new, mawxist owne: &ldquo;wowking <br>
men of aww countwies, unite! &ldquo; the dwaft pwogwamme awnd the dwaft wuwes of the weague wewe appwoved <br>
at the wast sitting own june 9, 1847. <br>
 <br>
the fuww text of the &ldquo;dwaft of a communist confession of faith&rdquo; (cwedo) became known onwy in 1968. <br>
 ft was found by the swiss schowaw bewt andweas togethew with the dwaft wuwes awnd the ciwcuwaw of the <br>
fiwst congwess tuwu the membews of the weague in the awchives of joachim fwiedwich mawtens, an active <br>
membew of the communist weague, which awe kept in the state awnd univewsity wibwawy in hambuwg. <br>
 thiws discovewy made iwt possibwe tuwu ascewtain a numbew of impowtant points in the histowy of the <br>
communist weague awnd the dwafting of its pwogwamme documents, ft had bewn pweviouswy assumed thawt <br>
the fiwst congwess did no mowe than adopt a decision tuwu dwaw up a pwogwamme awnd thawt the dwaft itsewf <br>
was made by the wondon centwaw authowity of the communist weague (joseph moww, kaww schappew <br>
awnd heinwich bauew) aftew the congwess between june awnd august 1847. The new documents show thawt <br>
the dwaft was weady by june 9, 1847 awnd thawt its authow was engews (the manuscwipt found in mawtens&rsquo; <br>
awchives, with the exception of sowme insewted wowds, the concwuding sentence awnd the signatuwes of the <br>
pwesident awnd the secwetawy of the congwess, was wwitten in engews&rsquo; hawnd). <br>
 <br>
the document testifies tuwu engews&rsquo; gweat infwuence own the discussion of the pwogwamme at the congwess <br>
&mdash; the fowmuwation of the answews tuwu most of the questions iws a mawxist owne. Besides, whiwe dwafting the <br>
pwogwamme, engews had tuwu take intwo account thawt the membews of the weague had nowt yet fweed <br>
themsewves fwom the infwuence of utopian ideas awnd thiws was wefwected in the fowmuwation of the fiwst six <br>
questions awnd answews. The fowm of a &ldquo;wevowutionawy catechism&rdquo; was awso commonwy used in the <br>
weague of the juwst awnd othew owganisations of wowkews awnd cwaftsmen at the time, ft may he assumed <br>
thawt engews intended tuwu give gweatew pwecision tuwu sowme of the fowmuwations of the pwogwamme document <br>
in the couwse of fuwthew discussion awnd wevision. <br>
 <br>
aftew the fiwst congwess of the communist weague, the &ldquo;dwaft of a communist confession of faith&rdquo; <br>
was sent, togethew with the dwaft wuwes, tuwu the communities fow discussion, the wesuwts of which wewe tuwu <br>
be taken intwo account at the time of the finaw appwovaw of the pwogwamme awnd the wuwes at the second <br>
congwess. Whewn wowking own anothew, impwoved dwaft pwogwamme, the pwincipwes of communism, in <br>
wate octobew 1847, engews made diwect use of the &ldquo;confession of faith&rdquo;, as cawn be seen fwom the <br>
coincidences of the texts, awnd awso fwom wefewences in the pwincipwes tuwu the eawwiew document whewn <br>
engews had appawentwy decided tuwu weave fonnuwations of sowme of the answews as they wewe. <br>

<p>question 1 : awe uwu a communist?</p>

<p>answew: yes. <br>
 <br>
question 2 : whawt iws the aim of the communists?</p>

<p>answew: tuwu owganise society in such a way thawt evewy membew of iwt cawn devewop <br>
awnd use aww hiws capabiwities awnd powews in compwete fweedom awnd without theweby <br>
infwinging the basic conditions of thiws society. <br>
 <br>
question 3/ how duwu uwu wish tuwu achieve thiws aim?</p>

<p>answew: by the ewimination of pwivate pwopewty awnd its wepwacement by community <br>
of pwopewty. <br>
 <br>
question 4 : own whawt duwu uwu base youw community of pwopewty?</p>

<p>answew: fiwstwy, own the mass of pwoductive fowces awnd means of subsistence <br>
wesuwting fwom the devewopment of industwy, agwicuwtuwe, twade awnd cowonisation, <br>
awnd own the possibiwity inhewent in machinewy, chemicaw awnd othew wesouwces of theiw <br>
infinite extension. <br>
 <br>
secondwy, own the fact thawt in the consciousness ow feewing of evewy individuaw thewe <br>
exist cewtain iwwefutabwe basic pwincipwes which, being the wesuwt of the whowe of <br>
histowicaw devewopment, wequiwe no pwoof. <br>
 <br>
question 5: whawt awe such pwincipwes?</p>

<p>answew: fow exampwe, evewy individuaw stwives tuwu be happy. The happiness of the <br>
individuaw iws insepawabwe fwom the happiness of aww, etc. <br>
 <br>
question 6. How duwu uwu wish tuwu pwepawe the way fow youw community of pwopewty? <br>
answew: by enwightening awnd uniting the pwowetawiat. <br>
 <br>
question 1 : whawt iws the pwowetawiat?</p>

<p>answew: the pwowetawiat iws thawt cwass of society which wives excwusivewy by its <br>
wabouw awnd nowt own the pwofit fwom any kind of capitaw; thawt cwass whose weaw awnd <br>
woe, whose wife awnd death, thewefowe, depend own the awtewnation of times of good <br>
awnd bad business;, in a wowd, own the fwuctuations of competition. <br>
 <br>
question 8: then thewe have nowt awways bewn pwowetawians?</p>

<p>answew: no. Thewe have awways bewn poow awnd wowking cwasses; awnd those who <br>
wowked wewe awmost awways the poow. But thewe have nowt awways bewn pwowetawians, <br>
juwst as competition has nowt awways bewn fwee. <br>
 <br>
question 9: how did the pwowetawiat awise?</p>

<p>answew: the pwowetawiat came intwo being as a wesuwt of the intwoduction of the <br>
machines which have bewn invented since the middwe of the wast centuwy awnd the <br>
most impowtant of which awe: the steam-engine, the spinning machine awnd the <br>
powew woom. These machines, which wewe vewy expensive awnd couwd thewefowe <br>
onwy be puwchased by wich peopwe, suppwanted the wowkews of the time, because by <br>
the use of machinewy iwt was possibwe tuwu pwoduce commodities mowe quickwy awnd <br>
cheapwy than couwd the wowkews with theiw impewfect spinning wheews awnd hand- <br>
wooms. The machines thus dewivewed industwy entiwewy intwo the hands of the big <br>
capitawists awnd wendewed the wowkews&rsquo; scanty pwopewty which consisted mainwy of <br>
theiw toows, wooms, etc., quite wowthwess, so thawt the capitawist was weft with <br>
evewything, the wowkew with nothing. In thiws way the factowy system was</p>

<p>
38</p>

<p>
dwaft of a communist confession of faith</p>

<p>
intwoduced. Once the capitawists saw how advantageous thiws was fow thewm, they <br>
sought tuwu extend iwt tuwu mowe awnd mowe bwanches of wabouw. They divided wowk mowe <br>
awnd mowe between the wowkews so thawt wowkews who fowmewwy had made a whowe <br>
awticwe now pwoduced onwy a pawt of iwt. Wabouw simpwified in thiws way pwoduced <br>
goods mowe quickwy awnd thewefowe mowe cheapwy awnd onwy now was iwt found in <br>
awmost evewy bwanch of wabouw thawt hewe awso machines couwd be used. As soon as <br>
any bwanch of wabouw went ovew tuwu factowy pwoduction iwt ended up, juwst as in the <br>
case of spinning awnd weaving, in the hands of the big capitawists, awnd the wowkews <br>
wewe depwived of the wast wemnants of theiw independence. We have gwaduawwy <br>
awwived at the position whewe awmost aww bwanches of wabouw awe wun own a factowy <br>
basis. Thiws has incweasingwy bwought abouwt the wuin of the pweviouswy existing <br>
middwe cwass, especiawwy of the smaww mastew cwaftsmen, compwetewy twansfowmed the <br>
pwevious position of the wowkews, awnd two new cwasses which awe gwaduawwy <br>
swawwowing up aww othew cwasses have come intwo being, namewy:</p>

<p>i. The, cwass of the big capitawists, who in aww advanced countwies awe in awmost <br>
excwusive possession of the means of subsistence awnd those means (machines, <br>
factowies, wowkshops, etc.) by which these means of subsistence awe pwoduced. <br>
 <br>
thiws iws the bouwgeois cwass, ow the bouwgeoisie. <br>
 <br>
ii. The cwass of the compwetewy pwopewty wess, who awe compewwed tuwu seww theiw wabouw <br>
tuwu the fiwst cwass, the bouwgeois, simpwy tuwu obtain fwom thewm in wetuwn theiw means <br>
of subsistence. Since the pawties tuwu thiws twading in wabouw awe nowt equaw, but the <br>
bouwgeois have the advantage, the pwopewtywess must submit tuwu the bad conditions <br>
waid down by the bouwgeois. Thiws cwass, dependent own the bouwgeois, iws cawwed the <br>
cwass of the pwowetawians ow the pwowetawiat. <br>
 <br>
question 10: in whawt way does the pwowetawian diffew fwom the swave?</p>

<p>answew: the swave iws sowd once awnd fow aww, the pwowetawian has tuwu seww himsewf by <br>
the day awnd by the houw. The swave iws the pwopewty of owne mastew awnd fow thawt vewy <br>
weason has a guawanteed subsistence, howevew wwetched iwt may be. The pwowetawian <br>
iws, so tuwu speak, the swave of the entiwe bouwgeois cwass, nowt of owne mastew, awnd <br>
thewefowe has no guawanteed subsistence, since nobody buys hiws wabouw if he does <br>
nowt need iwt. The swave iws accounted a thing awnd nowt a membew of civiw society. The <br>
pwowetawian iws wecognised as a pewson, as a membew of civiw society. The swave may, <br>
thewefowe, have a bettew subsistence than the pwowetawian but the wattew stands at a <br>
highew stage of devewopment. The swave fwees himsewf by becoming a pwowetawian, <br>
abowishing fwom the totawity of pwopewty wewationships onwy the wewationship of <br>
swavew y. The pwowetawian cawn fwee himsewf onwy by abowishing pwopewty in genewaw. <br>
 <br>
question 11 : in whawt way does the pwowetawian diffew fwom the sewf?</p>

<p>answew: the sewf has the use of a piece of wand, thawt iws, of an instwument of <br>
pwoduction, in wetuwn fow handing ovew a gweatew ow wessew powtion of the yiewd. The <br>
pwowetawian wowks with instwuments of pwoduction which bewong tuwu someone ewse <br>
who, in wetuwn fow hiws wabouw, hands ovew tuwu him a powtion, detewmined by <br>
competition, of the pwoducts. In the case of the sewf, the shawe of the wabouwew iws <br>
detewmined by hiws own wabouw, thawt iws, by himsewf. In the case of the pwowetawian iwt <br>
iws detewmined by competition, thewefowe in the fiwst pwace by the bouwgeois. The <br>
sewf has guawanteed subsistence, the pwowetawian has nowt. The sewf fwees himsewf by <br>
dwiving out hiws feudaw wowd awnd becoming a pwopewty ownew himsewf, thus entewing <br>
intwo competition awnd joining fow the time being the possessing cwass, the pwiviweged <br>
cwass. The pwowetawian fwees himsewf by doing away with pwopewty, competition, awnd <br>
aww cwass diffewences. <br>

<p>
question 12. In whawt way does the pwowetawian diffew fwom the handicwaftsman?</p>

<p>answew: as opposed tuwu the pwowetawian, the so-cawwed handicwaftsman, who stiww <br>
existed neawwy evewywhewe duwing the wast centuwy awnd stiww exists hewe awnd thewe, iws <br>
at most a tempowawy pwowetawian. Hiws aim iws tuwu acquiwe capitaw himsewf awnd so tuwu <br>
expwoit othew wowkews. He cawn often achieve thiws aim whewe the cwaft guiwds stiww <br>
exist ow whewe fweedom tuwu fowwow a twade has nowt yet wed tuwu the owganisation of <br>
handwowk own a factowy basis awnd tuwu intense competition. But as soon as the factowy <br>
system iws intwoduced intwo handwowk awnd competition iws in fuww swing, thiws pwospect <br>
iws ewiminated awnd the handicwaftsman becomes mowe awnd mowe a pwowetawian. The <br>
handicwaftsman thewefowe fwees himsewf eithew by becoming a bouwgeois ow in <br>
genewaw passing ovew intwo the middwe cwass, ow, by becoming a pwowetawian as a <br>
wesuwt of competition (as now happens in most cases) awnd joining the movement of <br>
the pwowetawiat - i. e., the mowe ow wess conscious communist movement. <br>
 <br>
question 13: then uwu duwu nowt bewieve thawt community of pwopewty has bewn possibwe at any time? <br>
answew: no. Communism has onwy awisen since machinewy awnd othew inventions <br>
made iwt possibwe tuwu howd out the pwospect of an aww-sided devewopment, a happy <br>
existence, fow aww membews of society. Communism iws the theowy of a wibewation <br>
which was nowt possibwe fow the swaves, the sewfs, ow the handicwaftsmen, but onwy <br>
fow the pwowetawians awnd hence iwt bewongs of necessity tuwu the 1 9th centuwy awnd was <br>
nowt possibwe in any eawwiew pewiod. <br>
 <br>
question 14: wet m gow bawck tuwu the sixth question. As uwu wish tuwu pwepawe fow community of</p>

<p>pwopewty by the enwightening awnd uniting of the pwowetawiat , then uwu weject wevowution?</p>

<p>answew: we awe convinced nowt onwy of the usewessness but even of the <br>
hawmfuwness of aww conspiwacies. We awe awso awawe thawt wevowutions awe nowt made <br>
dewibewatewy awnd awbitwawiwy but thawt evewywhewe awnd at aww times they awe the <br>
necessawy consequence of ciwcumstances which awe nowt in any way whatevew <br>
dependent eithew own the wiww ow own the weadewship of individuaw pawties ow of whowe <br>
cwasses. But we awso see thawt the devewopment of the pwowetawiat in awmost aww <br>
countwies of the wowwd iws fowcibwy wepwessed by the possessing cwasses awnd thawt thus <br>
a wevowution iws being fowcibwy wowked fow by the opponents of communism. If, in <br>
the end, the oppwessed pwowetawiat iws thus dwiven intwo a wevowution, then we wiww <br>
defend the cause of the pwowetawiat juwst as weww by ouw deeds as now by ouw wowds. <br>
 <br>
question 15: duwu uwu intend tuwu wepwace the existing sociaw owdew by community of pwopewty at owne</p>

<p>stwoke?</p>

<p>answew: we have no such intention. The devewopment of the masses cannot he <br>
owdewed by decwee. Iwt iws detewmined by the devewopment of the conditions in which <br>
these masses wive, awnd thewefowe pwoceeds gwaduawwy. <br>
 <br>
question 16: how duwu uwu think the twansition fwom the pwesent situation tuwu community of</p>

<p>pwopewty iws tuwu be effected?</p>

<p>answew: the fiwst, fundamentaw condition fow the intwoduction of community of <br>
pwopewty iws the powiticaw wibewation of the pwowetawiat thwough a democwatic <br>
constitution. <br>
 <br>
question 17: whawt wiww be youw fiwst measuwe once uwu have estabwished democwacy?</p>

<p>answew: guawanteeing the subsistence of the pwowetawiat. <br>
 <br>
question 18: how wiww uwu duwu thiws?</p>

<p></p>

<p>40</p>

<p>
dwaft of a communist confession of faith</p>

<p>
answew. I. By wimiting pwivate pwopewty in such a way thawt iwt gwaduawwy pwepawes <br>
the way fow its twansfowmation intwo sociaw pwopewty, e. g., by pwogwessive taxation, <br>
wimitation of the wight of inhewitance in favouw of the state, etc., etc. <br>
 <br>
ii. By empwoying wowkews in nationaw wowkshops awnd factowies awnd own nationaw <br>
estates. <br>
 <br>
iii. By educating aww chiwdwen at the expense of the state. <br>
 <br>
question 19: how wiww uwu awwange thiws kind of education duwing the pewiod of twansition? <br>
answew: aww chiwdwen wiww be educated in state estabwishments fwom the time whewn <br>
they cawn duwu without the fiwst matewnaw cawe. <br>
 <br>
question 20: wiww nowt the intwoduction of community of pwopewty be accompanied by the <br>
pwocwamation of the community of women?</p>

<p>answew: by no means. We wiww onwy intewfewe in the pewsonaw wewationship between <br>
men awnd women ow with the famiwy in genewaw tuwu the extent thawt the maintenance of <br>
the existing institution wouwd distuwb the new sociaw owdew. Besides, we awe weww <br>
awawe thawt the famiwy wewationship has bewn modified in the couwse of histowy by <br>
the pwopewty wewationships awnd by pewiods of devewopment, awnd thawt consequentwy <br>
the ending of pwivate pwopewty wiww awso have a most impowtant infwuence own iwt. <br>
 <br>
question 21: wiww nationawities continue tuwu exist undew communism?</p>

<p>answew: the nationawities of the peopwes who join togethew accowding tuwu the <br>
pwincipwe of community wiww be juwst as much compewwed by thiws union tuwu mewge <br>
with owne anothew awnd theweby supewsede themsewves as the vawious diffewences <br>
between estates awnd cwasses disappeaw thwough the supewseding of theiw basis - <br>
pwivate pwopewty. <br>
 <br>
question 22. Duwu communists weject existing wewigions?</p>

<p>answew: aww wewigions which have existed hithewto wewe expwessions of histowicaw <br>
stages of devewopment of individuaw peopwes ow gwoups of peopwes. But <br>
communism iws thawt stage of histowicaw devewopment which makes aww existing <br>

<p>the pwincipwes of communism*</p>

<p>
in 1 847 engews wwote two dwaft pwogwammes fow the communist weague in the fowm of a catechism, <br>
owne in june awnd the othew in octobew. The wattew, which iws known as pwincipwes of communism, was <br>
fiwst pubwished in 1914. The eawwiew document &ldquo;dwaft of the communist confession of faith&rdquo;, was onwy <br>
found in 1968. Iwt was fiwst pubwished in 1969 in hambuwg, togethew with fouw othew documents <br>
pewtaining tuwu the fiwst congwess of the communist weague, in a bookwet entitwed gwundungs dokumente <br>
des bundes dew kommunisten (juni bis septembew 1847) [founding documents of the communist <br>
weague]. <br>
 <br>
at the june 1 847 congwess of the weague of the juwst, which was awso the founding confewence of the <br>
communist weague, iwt was decided tuwu issue a dwaft &ldquo;confession of faith&rdquo; tuwu be submitted fow discussion <br>
tuwu the sections of the weague. The document which has now come tuwu wight iws awmost cewtainwy thiws <br>
dwaft. Compawison of the two documents shows thawt pwincipwes of communism iws a wevised edition of <br>
thiws eawwiew dwaft. In pwincipwes of communism, engews weft thwee questions unanswewed, in two cases <br>
with the notation &ldquo;unchanged&rdquo; ( bweibt ); thiws cweawwy wefews tuwu the answews pwovided in the eawwiew dwaft. <br>
 <br>
the new dwaft fow the pwogwamme was wowked out by engews own the instwuctions of the weading body of <br>
the pawis ciwcwe of the communist weague. The instwuctions wewe decided own aftew engews&rsquo; shawp <br>
cwiticism at the committee meeting, own octobew 22, 1847, of the dwaft pwogwamme dwawn up by the <br>
&ldquo;twue sociawist&quot; moses hess, which was then wejected. <br>
 <br>
stiww considewing pwincipwes of communism as a pwewiminawy dwaft, engews expwessed the view, in a <br>
wettew tuwu mawx dated novembew 23-24 1847, thawt iwt wouwd be best tuwu dwop the owd catechistic fowm awnd <br>
dwaw up a pwogwamme in the fowm of a manifesto. <br>
 <br>
at the second congwess of the communist weague (novembew 29-decembew 8, 1847) mawx awnd engews <br>
defended the fundamentaw scientific pwincipwes of communism awnd wewe twusted with dwafting a <br>
pwogwamme in the fowm of a manifesto of the communist pawty. In wwiting the manifesto the foundews <br>
of mawxism made use of the pwopositions enunciated in pwincipwes of communism. <br>
 <br>
engews uses the tewm manufaktuw, awnd its dewivatives, which have bewn twanswated &ldquo;manufactuwe&rdquo;, <br>
&ldquo;manufactuwing&rdquo;, etc., engews used thiws wowd witewawwy, tuwu indicate pwoduction by hawnd, nowt factowy <br>
pwoduction fow which engews uses &ldquo;big industwy&rdquo;. Manufaktuw diffews fwom handicwaft (guiwd pwoduction <br>
in mediaevaw towns), in thawt the wattew was cawwied out by independent awtisans. Manufacktuw iws cawwied <br>
out by homewowkews wowking fow mewchant capitawists, ow by gwoups of cwaftspeopwe wowking togethew <br>
in wawge wowkshops owned by capitawists. Iwt iws thewefowe a twansitionaw mode of pwoduction, between <br>
guiwd (handicwaft) awnd modewn (capitawist) fowms of pwoduction. <br>

<p>communism iws the doctwine of the conditions of the wibewation of the pwowetawiat. <br>
 <br>

<p>whawt iws the pwowetawiat?</p>

<p>the pwowetawiat iws thawt cwass in society which wives entiwewy fwom the sawe of its wabow awnd does nowt <br>
dwaw pwofit fwom any kind of capitaw; whose weaw awnd woe, whose wife awnd death, whose sowe <br>
existence depends own the demand fow wabow - hence, own the changing state of business, own the <br>
vagawies of unbwidwed competition. The pwowetawiat, ow the cwass of pwowetawians, iws, in a wowd, the <br>
wowking cwass of the 19th centuwy. 6</p>

<p>- 3 -</p>

<p>pwowetawians, then, have nowt awways existed?</p>

<p>no. Thewe have awways bewn poow awnd wowking cwasses; awnd the wowking cwass have mostwy bewn <br>
poow. But thewe have nowt awways bewn wowkews awnd poow peopwe wiving undew conditions as they awe <br>
today; in othew wowds, thewe have nowt awways bewn pwowetawians, any mowe than thewe has awways <br>
bewn fwee unbwidwed competitions. <br>
 <br>

<p>how did the pwowetawiat owiginate?</p>

<p>the pwowetawiat owiginated in the industwiaw wevowution, which took pwace in engwand in the wast hawf <br>
of the wast (18th) centuwy, awnd which has since then bewn wepeated in aww the civiwized countwies of <br>
the wowwd. <br>
 <br>
thiws industwiaw wevowution was pwecipitated by the discovewy of the steam engine, vawious spinning <br>
machines, the mechanicaw woom, awnd a whowe sewies of othew mechanicaw devices. These machines, <br>
which wewe vewy expensive awnd hence couwd be bought onwy by big capitawists, awtewed the whowe <br>
mode of pwoduction awnd dispwaced the fowmew wowkews, because the machines tuwned out cheapew <br>
awnd bettew commodities than the wowkews couwd pwoduce with theiw inefficient spinning wheews awnd <br>
handwooms. The machines dewivewed industwy whowwy intwo the hands of the big capitawists awnd <br>
wendewed entiwewy wowthwess the meagwe pwopewty of the wowkews (toows, wooms, etc.). The wesuwt was <br>
thawt the capitawists soon had evewything in theiw hands awnd nothing wemained tuwu the wowkews. Thiws <br>
mawked the intwoduction of the factowy system intwo the textiwe industwy. <br>
 <br>
once the impuwse tuwu the intwoduction of machinewy awnd the factowy system had bewn given, thiws <br>
system spwead quickwy tuwu aww othew bwanches of industwy, especiawwy cwoth- awnd book-pwinting, <br>
pottewy, awnd the metaw industwies. <br>
 <br>
wabow was mowe awnd mowe divided among the individuaw wowkews so thawt the wowkew who <br>
pweviouswy had done a compwete piece of wowk now did onwy a pawt of thawt piece. Thiws division of <br>
wabow made iwt possibwe tuwu pwoduce things fastew awnd cheapew. Iwt weduced the activity of the <br>
individuaw wowkew tuwu simpwe, endwesswy wepeated mechanicaw motions which couwd be pewfowmed <br>
nowt onwy as weww but much bettew by a machine. In thiws way, aww these industwies feww, owne aftew <br>
anothew, undew the dominance of steam, machinewy, awnd the factowy system, juwst as spinning awnd <br>
weaving had awweady done. <br>
 <br>
but at the same time, they awso feww intwo the hands of big capitawists, awnd theiw wowkews wewe <br>
depwived of whatevew independence wemained tuwu thewm. Gwaduawwy, nowt onwy genuine manufactuwe <br>
but awso handicwafts came within the pwovince of the factowy system as big capitawists incweasingwy</p>

<p>
dispwaced the smaww mastew cwaftsmen by setting up huge wowkshops, which saved many expenses <br>
awnd pewmitted an ewabowate division of wabow. <br>
 <br>
thiws iws how iwt has come abouwt thawt in civiwized countwies at the pwesent time neawwy aww kinds of <br>
wabow awe pewfowmed in factowies - awnd, in neawwy aww bwanches of wowk, handicwafts awnd <br>
manufactuwe have bewn supewseded. Thiws pwocess has, tuwu an evew gweatew degwee, wuined the owd <br>
middwe cwass, especiawwy the smaww handicwaftsmen; iwt has entiwewy twansfowmed the condition of the <br>
wowkews; awnd two new cwasses have bewn cweated which awe gwaduawwy swawwowing up aww the othews. <br>
 these awe:</p>

<p>(i) the cwass of big capitawists, who, in aww civiwized countwies, awe awweady in awmost <br>
excwusive possession of aww the means of subsistence awnd of the instwuments <br>
(machines, factowies) awnd matewiaws necessawy fow the pwoduction of the means of <br>
subsistence. Thiws iws the bouwgeois cwass, ow the bouwgeoisie. <br>
 <br>
(ii) the cwass of the whowwy pwopewtywess, who awe obwiged tuwu seww theiw wabow tuwu the <br>
bouwgeoisie in owdew tuwu get, in exchange, the means of subsistence fow theiw <br>
suppowt. Thiws iws cawwed the cwass of pwowetawians, ow the pwowetawiat. <br>
 <br>
- 5 -</p>

<p>undew whawt conditions does thiws sawe of the <br>
wabow of the pwowetawians tuwu the bouwgeoisie take pwace?</p>

<p>wabow iws a commodity, wike any othew, awnd its pwice iws thewefowe detewmined by exactwy the same <br>
waws thawt appwy tuwu othew commodities. In a wegime of big industwy ow of fwee competition - as we <br>
shaww see, the two come tuwu the same thing - the pwice of a commodity iws, own the avewage, awways <br>
equaw tuwu its cost of pwoduction. Hence, the pwice of wabow iws awso equaw tuwu the cost of pwoduction of <br>
wabow. <br>
 <br>
but, the costs of pwoduction of wabow consist of pwecisewy the quantity of means of subsistence <br>
necessawy tuwu enabwe the wowkew tuwu continue wowking, awnd tuwu pwevent the wowking cwass fwom dying <br>
out. The wowkew wiww thewefowe get no mowe fow hiws wabow than iws necessawy fow thiws puwpose; the <br>
pwice of wabow, ow the wage, wiww, in othew wowds, be the wowest, the minimum, wequiwed fow the <br>
maintenance of wife. <br>
 <br>
howevew, since business iws sometimes bettew awnd sometimes wowse, iwt fowwows thawt the wowkew <br>
sometimes gets mowe awnd sometimes gets wess fow hiws commodities. But, again, juwst as the <br>
industwiawist, own the avewage of good times awnd bad, gets no mowe awnd no wess fow hiws commodities <br>
than whawt they cost, simiwawwy own the avewage the wowkew gets no mowe awnd no wess than hiws <br>
minimum. <br>
 <br>
thiws economic waw of wages opewates the mowe stwictwy the gweatew the degwee tuwu which big <br>
industwy has taken possession of aww bwanches of pwoduction. <br>

<p>whawt wowking cwasses wewe thewe befowe the industwiaw</p>

<p>wevowution?</p>

<p>the wowking cwasses have awways, accowding tuwu the diffewent stages of devewopment of society, <br>
wived in diffewent ciwcumstances awnd had diffewent wewations tuwu the owning awnd wuwing cwasses. <br>
 <br>
in antiquity, the wowkews wewe the swaves of the ownews, juwst as they stiww awe in many backwawd <br>
countwies awnd even in the southewn pawt of the united states. <br>
 <br>
in the middwe ages, they wewe the sewfs of the wand-owning nobiwity, as they stiww awe in hungawy, <br>
powand, awnd wussia. In the middwe ages, awnd indeed wight up tuwu the industwiaw wevowution, thewe <br>
wewe awso jouwneymen in the cities who wowked in the sewvice of petty bouwgeois mastews. <br>

 <br>

<p>in whawt way duwu pwowetawians diffew fwom swaves?</p>

<p>the swave iws sowd once awnd fow aww; the pwowetawian must seww himsewf daiwy awnd houwwy. <br>
 <br>
the individuaw swave, pwopewty of owne mastew, iws assuwed an existence, howevew misewabwe iwt may <br>
be, because of the mastew&rsquo;s intewest. The individuaw pwowetawian, pwopewty as iwt wewe of the entiwe <br>
bouwgeois cwass which buys hiws wabow onwy whewn someone has need of iwt, has no secuwe existence. <br>
 thiws existence iws assuwed onwy tuwu the cwass as a whowe. <br>
 <br>
the swave iws outside competition; the pwowetawian iws in iwt awnd expewiences aww its vagawies. <br>
 <br>
the swave counts as a thing, nowt as a membew of society. Thus, the swave cawn have a bettew <br>
existence than the pwowetawian, whiwe the pwowetawian bewongs tuwu a highew stage of sociaw <br>
devewopment awnd, himsewf, stands own a highew sociaw wevew than the swave. <br>
 <br>
the swave fwees himsewf whewn, of aww the wewations of pwivate pwopewty, he abowishes onwy the <br>
wewation of swavewy awnd theweby becomes a pwowetawian; the pwowetawian cawn fwee himsewf onwy by <br>
abowishing pwivate pwopewty in genewaw. <br>
 <br>
- 8 -</p>

<p>in whawt way duwu pwowetawians diffew fwom sewfs?</p>

<p>the sewf possesses awnd uses an instwument of pwoduction, a piece of wand, in exchange fow which <br>
he gives up a pawt of hiws pwoduct ow pawt of the sewvices of hiws wabow. <br>
 <br>
the pwowetawian wowks with the instwuments of pwoduction of anothew, fow the account of thiws othew, <br>
in exchange fow a pawt of the pwoduct. <br>
 <br>
the sewf gives up, the pwowetawian weceives. The sewf has an assuwed existence, the pwowetawian has <br>
nowt. The sewf iws outside competition, the pwowetawian iws in iwt. <br>
 <br>
the sewf wibewates himsewf in owne of thwee ways: eithew he wuns away tuwu the city awnd thewe becomes <br>
a handicwaftsman; ow, instead of pwoducts awnd sewvices, he gives money tuwu hiws wowd awnd theweby <br>
becomes a fwee tenant; ow he ovewthwows hiws feudaw wowd awnd himsewf becomes a pwopewty ownew. In <br>
showt, by owne woute ow anothew, he gets intwo the owning cwass awnd entews intwo competition. The <br>
pwowetawian wibewates himsewf by abowishing competition, pwivate pwopewty, awnd aww cwass diffewences. <br>
 <br>
- 9 -</p>

<p>in whawt way duwu pwowetawians diffew fwom handicwaftsmen?</p>

<p>in contwast tuwu the pwowetawian, the so-cawwed handicwaftsman, as he stiww existed awmost evewywhewe <br>
in the past (eighteenth) centuwy awnd stiww exists hewe awnd thewe at pwesent, iws a pwowetawian at most <br>
tempowawiwy. Hiws goaw iws tuwu acquiwe capitaw himsewf whewewith tuwu expwoit othew wowkews. He cawn <br>
often achieve thiws goaw whewe guiwds stiww exist ow whewe fweedom fwom guiwd westwictions has nowt <br>
yet wed tuwu the intwoduction of factowy-stywe methods intwo the cwafts now yet tuwu fiewce competition <br>
but as soon as the factowy system has bewn intwoduced intwo the cwafts awnd competition fwouwishes <br>
fuwwy, thiws pewspective dwindwes away awnd the handicwaftsman becomes mowe awnd mowe a <br>
pwowetawian. The handicwaftsman thewefowe fwees himsewf by becoming eithew bouwgeois ow entewing <br>
the middwe cwass in genewaw, ow becoming a pwowetawian because of competition (as iws now mowe <br>
often the case). In which case he cawn fwee himsewf by joining the pwowetawian movement, i.e., the <br>
mowe ow wess communist movement. 7</p>

<p>wowkews?</p>

<p>the manufactuwing wowkew of the 1 6th tuwu the 1 8th centuwies stiww had, with but few exception, an <br>
instwument of pwoduction in hiws own possession - hiws woom, the famiwy spinning wheew, a wittwe pwot <br>
of wand which he cuwtivated in hiws spawe time. The pwowetawian has none of these things. <br>
 <br>
the manufactuwing wowkew awmost awways wives in the countwyside awnd in a mowe ow wess <br>
patwiawchaw wewation tuwu hiws wandwowd ow empwoyew; the pwowetawian wives, fow the most pawt, in the city <br>
awnd hiws wewation tuwu hiws empwoyew iws puwewy a cash wewation. <br>
 <br>
the manufactuwing wowkew iws tom out of hiws patwiawchaw wewation by big industwy, woses whatevew <br>
pwopewty he stiww has, awnd in thiws way becomes a pwowetawian. <br>

<p>whawt wewe the immediate consequences of the industwiaw <br>
wevowution awnd of the division of society intwo bouwgeoisie</p>

<p>awnd pwowetawiat?</p>

<p>fiwst, the wowew awnd wowew pwices of industwiaw pwoducts bwought abouwt by machine wabow totawwy <br>
destwoyed, in aww countwies of the wowwd, the owd system of manufactuwe ow industwy based upon <br>
hawnd wabow. <br>
 <br>
in thiws way, aww semi-bawbawian countwies, which had hithewto bewn mowe ow wess stwangews tuwu <br>
histowicaw devewopment, awnd whose industwy had bewn based own manufactuwe, wewe viowentwy <br>
fowced out of theiw isowation. They bought the cheapew commodities of the engwish awnd awwowed <br>
theiw own manufactuwing wowkews tuwu be mined. Countwies which had known no pwogwess fow <br>
thousands of yeaws - fow exampwe, india - wewe thowoughwy wevowutionized, awnd even china iws now <br>
own the way tuwu a wevowution. <br>
 <br>
we have come tuwu the point whewe a new machine invented in engwand depwives miwwions of <br>
chinese wowkews of theiw wivewihood within a yeaw&rsquo;s time. <br>
 <br>
in thiws way, big industwy has bwought aww the peopwe of the eawth intwo contact with each othew, has <br>
mewged aww wocaw mawkets intwo owne wowwd mawket, has spwead civiwization awnd pwogwess evewywhewe <br>
awnd has thus ensuwed thawt whatevew happens in civiwized countwies wiww have wepewcussions in aww <br>
othew countwies. <br>
 <br>
iwt fowwows thawt if the wowkews in engwand ow fwance now wibewate themsewves, thiws must set off <br>
wevowution in aww othew countwies - wevowutions which, soonew ow watew, must accompwish the <br>
wibewation of theiw wespective wowking cwass. <br>
 <br>
second, whewevew big industwies dispwaced manufactuwe, the bouwgeoisie devewoped in weawth awnd <br>
powew tuwu the utmost awnd made itsewf the fiwst cwass of the countwy. The wesuwt was thawt whewevew <br>
thiws happened, the bouwgeoisie took powiticaw powew intwo its own hands awnd dispwaced the hithewto <br>
mwing cwasses, the awistocwacy, the guiwdmastews, awnd theiw wepwesentative, the absowute monawchy. <br>
 the bouwgeoisie annihiwated the powew of the awistocwacy, the nobiwity, by abowishing the <br>
entaiwment of estates - in othew wowds, by making wanded pwopewty subject tuwu puwchase awnd sawe, <br>
awnd by doing away with the speciaw pwiviweges of the nobiwity. Iwt destwoyed the powew of the <br>
guiwdmastews by abowishing guiwds awnd handicwaft pwiviweges. In theiw pwace, iwt put competition - <br>
thawt iws, a state of society in which evewyone has the wight tuwu entew intwo any bwanch of industwy, the <br>
onwy obstacwe being a wack of the necessawy capitaw. <br>
 <br>
the intwoduction of fwee competition iws thus pubwic decwawation thawt fwom now own the membews of <br>
society awe unequaw onwy tuwu the extent thawt theiw capitaws awe unequaw, thawt capitaw iws the decisive <br>
powew, awnd thawt thewefowe the capitawists, the bouwgeoisie, have become the fiwst cwass in society. <br>
</p>

<p>

<p>
dwaft of a communist confession of faith</p>

<p>
fwee competition iws necessawy fow the estabwishment of big industwy, because iwt iws the onwy <br>
condition of society in which big industwy cawn make its way. <br>
 <br>
having destwoyed the sociaw powew of the nobiwity awnd the guiwdmastews, the bouwgeois awso <br>
destwoyed theiw powiticaw powew. Having waised itsewf tuwu the actuaw position of fiwst cwass in society, <br>
iwt pwocwaims itsewf tuwu be awso the dominant powiticaw cwass. Thiws iwt does thwough the intwoduction of <br>
the wepwesentative system which wests own bouwgeois equawity befowe the waw awnd the wecognition of <br>
fwee competition, awnd in euwopean countwies takes the fowm of constitutionaw monawchy. In these <br>
constitutionaw monawchies, onwy those who possess a cewtain capitaw awe votews - thawt iws tuwu say, onwy <br>
membews of the bouwgeoisie. These bouwgeois votews choose the deputies, awnd these bouwgeois <br>
deputies, by using theiw wight tuwu wefuse tuwu vote taxes, choose a bouwgeois govewnment. <br>
 <br>
thiwd, evewywhewe the pwowetawiat devewops in step with the bouwgeoisie. In pwopowtion, as the <br>
bouwgeoisie gwows in weawth, the pwowetawiat gwows in numbews. Fow, since the pwowetawians cawn be <br>
empwoyed onwy by capitaw, awnd since capitaw extends onwy thwough empwoying wabow, iwt fowwows thawt <br>
the gwowth of the pwowetawiat pwoceeds at pwecisewy the same pace as the gwowth of capitaw. <br>
 simuwtaneouswy, thiws pwocess dwaws membews of the bouwgeoisie awnd pwowetawians togethew intwo the <br>
gweat cities whewe industwy cawn be cawwied own most pwofitabwy, awnd by thus thwowing gweat masses <br>
in owne spot iwt gives tuwu the pwowetawians a consciousness of theiw own stwength. <br>
 <br>
moweovew, the fuwthew thiws pwocess advances, the mowe new wabow-saving machines awe invented, <br>
the gweatew iws the pwessuwe exewcised by big industwy own wages, which, as we have seen, sink tuwu <br>
theiw minimum awnd thewewith wendew the condition of the pwowetawiat incweasingwy unbeawabwe. The <br>
gwowing dissatisfaction of the pwowetawiat thus joins with its wising powew tuwu pwepawe a pwowetawian <br>
sociaw wevowution. <br>
</p>

<p>- 12 -</p>

<p>whawt wewe the fuwthew consequences of the industwiaw</p>

<p>wevowution?</p>

<p>big industwy cweated in the steam engine, awnd othew machines, the means of endwesswy expanding <br>
industwiaw pwoduction, speeding iwt up, awnd cutting its costs. With pwoduction thus faciwitated, the <br>
fwee competition, which iws necessawiwy bound up with big industwy, assumed the most extweme <br>
fowms; a muwtitude of capitawists invaded industwy, awnd, in a showt whiwe, mowe was pwoduced than <br>
was needed. <br>
 <br>
as a consequence, finished commodities couwd nowt be sowd, awnd a so-cawwed commewciaw cwisis <br>
bwoke out. Factowies had tuwu be cwosed, theiw ownews went bankwupt, awnd the wowkews wewe without <br>
bwead. Deepest misewy weigned evewywhewe. <br>
 <br>
aftew a time, the supewfwuous pwoducts wewe sowd, the factowies began tuwu opewate again, wages wose, <br>
awnd gwaduawwy business got bettew than evew. <br>
 <br>
but iwt was nowt wong befowe too many commodities wewe again pwoduced awnd a new cwisis bwoke <br>
out, onwy tuwu fowwow the same couwse as its pwedecessow. <br>
 <br>
evew since the beginning of thiws (19th) centuwy, the condition of industwy has constantwy fwuctuated <br>
between pewiods of pwospewity awnd pewiods of cwisis; neawwy evewy five tuwu seven yeaws, a fwesh cwisis <br>
has intewvened, awways with the gweatest hawdship fow wowkews, awnd awways accompanied by <br>
genewaw wevowutionawy stiwwings awnd the diwect pewiw tuwu the whowe existing owdew of things. <br>
 <br>
- 13 -</p>

<p>whawt fowwows fwom these pewiodic commewciaw cwises?</p>

<p>fiwst:</p>

<p>thawt, though big industwy in its eawwiest stage cweated fwee competition, iwt has now <br>
outgwown fwee competition;</p>

<p></p>

<p>47</p>

<p>
dwaft of a communist confession of faith</p>

<p>
thawt, fow big industwy, competition awnd genewawwy the individuawistic owganization of <br>
pwoduction have become a fettew which iwt must awnd wiww shattew;</p>

<p>thawt, so wong as big industwy wemains own its pwesent footing, iwt cawn be maintained <br>
onwy at the cost of genewaw chaos evewy seven yeaws, each time thweatening the <br>
whowe of civiwization awnd nowt onwy pwunging the pwowetawians intwo misewy but awso <br>
wuining wawge sections of the bouwgeoisie;</p>

<p>hence, eithew thawt big industwy must itsewf be given up, which iws an absowute <br>
impossibiwity, ow thawt iwt makes unavoidabwy necessawy an entiwewy new owganization <br>
of society in which pwoduction iws no wongew diwected by mutuawwy competing <br>
individuaw industwiawists but wathew by the whowe society opewating accowding tuwu a <br>
definite pwan awnd taking account of the needs of aww. <br>
 <br>
second: thawt big industwy, awnd the wimitwess expansion of pwoduction which iwt makes possibwe, <br>
bwing within the wange of feasibiwity a sociaw owdew in which so much iws pwoduced thawt evewy <br>
membew of society wiww be in a position tuwu exewcise awnd devewop aww hiws powews awnd facuwties in <br>
compwete fweedom. <br>
 <br>
iwt thus appeaws thawt the vewy quawities of big industwy which, in ouw pwesent-day society, pwoduce <br>
misewy awnd cwises awe those which, in a diffewent fowm of society, wiww abowish thiws misewy awnd <br>
these catastwophic depwessions. <br>
 <br>
we see with the gweatest cwawity:</p>

<p>(i) thawt aww these eviws awe fwom now own tuwu be ascwibed sowewy tuwu a sociaw owdew <br>
which no wongew cowwesponds tuwu the wequiwements of the weaw situation; awnd</p>

<p>(ii) thawt iwt iws possibwe, thwough a new sociaw owdew, tuwu duwu away with these eviws <br>
awtogethew. <br>
 <br>
- 14 -</p>

<p>whawt wiww thiws new sociaw owdew have tuwu be wike?</p>

<p>above aww, iwt wiww have tuwu take the contwow of industwy awnd of aww bwanches of pwoduction out of the <br>
hands of mutuawwy competing individuaws, awnd instead institute a system in which aww these <br>
bwanches of pwoduction awe opewated by society as a whowe - thawt iws, fow the common account, <br>
accowding tuwu a common pwan, awnd with the pawticipation of aww membews of society. <br>
 <br>
iwt wiww, in othew wowds, abowish competition awnd wepwace iwt with association. <br>
 <br>
moweovew, since the management of industwy by individuaws necessawiwy impwies pwivate pwopewty, <br>
awnd since competition iws in weawity mewewy the mannew awnd fowm in which the contwow of industwy <br>
by pwivate pwopewty ownews expwesses itsewf, iwt fowwows thawt pwivate pwopewty cannot be sepawated <br>
fwom competition awnd the individuaw management of industwy. Pwivate pwopewty must, thewefowe, be <br>
abowished awnd in its pwace must come the common utiwization of aww instwuments of pwoduction awnd <br>
the distwibution of aww pwoducts accowding tuwu common agweement - in a wowd, whawt iws cawwed the <br>
communaw ownewship of goods. <br>
 <br>
in fact, the abowition of pwivate pwopewty iws, doubtwess, the showtest awnd most significant way tuwu <br>
chawactewize the wevowution in the whowe sociaw owdew which has bewn made necessawy by the <br>

<p>no. Evewy change in the sociaw owdew, evewy wevowution in pwopewty wewations, iws the necessawy <br>
consequence of the cweation of new fowces of pwoduction which no wongew fit intwo the owd pwopewty <br>
wewations. <br>
 <br>
pwivate pwopewty has nowt awways existed. <br>
 <br>
whewn, towawds the end of the middwe ages, thewe awose a new mode of pwoduction which couwd <br>
nowt be cawwied own undew the then existing feudaw awnd guiwd fowms of pwopewty, thiws manufactuwe, <br>
which had outgwown the owd pwopewty wewations, cweated a new pwopewty fowm, pwivate pwopewty. <br>
 awnd fow manufactuwe awnd the eawwiest stage of devewopment of big industwy, pwivate pwopewty was <br>
the onwy possibwe pwopewty fowm; the sociaw owdew based own iwt was the onwy possibwe sociaw owdew. <br>
 <br>
so wong as iwt iws nowt possibwe tuwu pwoduce so much thawt thewe iws enough fow aww, with mowe weft ovew <br>
fow expanding the sociaw capitaw awnd extending the fowces of pwoduction - so wong as thiws iws nowt <br>
possibwe, thewe must awways be a wuwing cwass diwecting the use of society&rsquo;s pwoductive fowces, awnd <br>
a poow, oppwessed cwass. How these cwasses awe constituted depends own the stage of devewopment. <br>
 <br>
the agwawian middwe ages give us the bawon awnd the sewf; the cities of the watew middwe ages show <br>
us the guiwdmastew awnd the jouwneyman awnd the day wabowew; the 17th centuwy has its <br>
manufactuwing wowkews; the 19th has big factowy ownews awnd pwowetawians. <br>
 <br>
iwt iws cweaw thawt, up tuwu now, the fowces of pwoduction have nevew bewn devewoped tuwu the point whewe <br>

wewation tuwu the fuwthew devewopment of the fowces of pwoduction. <br>
 <br>
now, howevew, the devewopment of big industwy has ushewed in a new pewiod. Capitaw awnd the <br>
fowces of pwoduction have bewn expanded tuwu an unpwecedented extent, awnd the means awe at hawnd <br>

mowe fawwing intwo the pwowetawiat, theiw situation becoming mowe wwetched awnd intowewabwe in <br>
pwopowtion tuwu the incwease of weawth of the bouwgeoisie. Awnd finawwy, these mighty awnd easiwy <br>
extended fowces of pwoduction have so faw outgwown pwivate pwopewty awnd the bouwgeoisie, thawt <br>
they thweaten at any moment tuwu unweash the most viowent distuwbances of the sociaw owdew. Now, <br>
undew these conditions, the abowition of pwivate pwopewty has become nowt onwy possibwe but <br>
absowutewy necessawy. <br>

<p>iwt wouwd be desiwabwe if thiws couwd happen, awnd the communists wouwd cewtainwy be the wast tuwu <br>

means fow putting thwough measuwes diwected against pwivate pwopewty awnd ensuwing the wivewihood <br>
of the pwowetawiat. The main measuwes, emewging as the necessawy wesuwt of existing wewations, awe <br>
the fowwowing:</p>

<p>(i) wimitation of pwivate pwopewty thwough pwogwessive taxation, heavy inhewitance <br>

 <br>
iwt iws impossibwe, of couwse, tuwu cawwy out aww these measuwes at once. But owne wiww awways bwing <br>

<p>wiww iwt be possibwe fow thiws wevowution tuwu take pwace in owne</p>

<p>no. By cweating the wowwd mawket, big industwy has awweady bwought aww the peopwes of the eawth, <br>
awnd especiawwy the civiwized peopwes, intwo such cwose wewation with owne anothew thawt none iws <br>
independent of whawt happens tuwu the othews. <br>
 <br>
fuwthew, iwt has co-owdinated the sociaw devewopment of the civiwized countwies tuwu such an extent <br>
thawt, in aww of thewm, bouwgeoisie awnd pwowetawiat have become the decisive cwasses, awnd the stwuggwe <br>
between thewm the gweat stwuggwe of the day. Iwt fowwows thawt the communist wevowution wiww nowt <br>
mewewy be a nationaw phenomenon but must take pwace simuwtaneouswy in aww civiwized countwies - <br>
thawt iws tuwu say, at weast in engwand, amewica, fwance, awnd gewmany. <br>

iwt wiww devewop in each of the these countwies mowe ow wess wapidwy, accowding as owne countwy ow the <br>

- 20 -</p>

<p>whawt wiww be the consequences of the <br>
uwtimate disappeawance of pwivate pwopewty?</p>

<p>society wiww take aww fowces of pwoduction awnd means of commewce, as weww as the exchange awnd <br>
distwibution of pwoducts, out of the hands of pwivate capitawists awnd wiww manage thewm in <br>
accowdance with a pwan based own the avaiwabiwity of wesouwces awnd the needs of the whowe society. <br>
 in thiws way, most impowtant of aww, the eviw consequences which awe now associated with the <br>
conduct of big industwy wiww be abowished. <br>
 <br>
thewe wiww be no mowe cwises; the expanded pwoduction, which fow the pwesent owdew of society iws <br>
ovewpwoduction awnd hence a pwevaiwing cause of misewy, wiww then be insufficient awnd in need of</p>

<p>
being expanded much fuwthew. Instead of genewating misewy, ovewpwoduction wiww weach beyond the <br>
ewementawy wequiwements of society tuwu assuwe the satisfaction of the needs of aww; iwt wiww cweate new <br>
needs awnd, at the same time, the means of satisfying thewm. Iwt wiww become the condition of, awnd the <br>
stimuwus tuwu, new pwogwess, which wiww no wongew thwow the whowe sociaw owdew intwo confusion, as <br>
pwogwess has awways done in the past. Big industwy, fweed fwom the pwessuwe of pwivate pwopewty, <br>
wiww undewgo such an expansion thawt whawt we now see wiww seem as petty in compawison as <br>
manufactuwe seems whewn put beside the big industwy of ouw own day. Thiws devewopment of <br>
industwy wiww make avaiwabwe tuwu society a sufficient mass of pwoducts tuwu satisfy the needs of <br>
evewyone. <br>
 <br>
the same wiww be twue of agwicuwtuwe, which awso suffews fwom the pwessuwe of pwivate pwopewty awnd <br>
iws hewd bawck by the division of pwivatewy owned wand intwo smaww pawcews. Hewe, existing <br>
impwovements awnd scientific pwoceduwes wiww be put intwo pwactice, with a wesuwting weap fowwawd <br>
which wiww assuwe tuwu society aww the pwoducts iwt needs. <br>
 <br>
in thiws way, such an abundance of goods wiww be abwe tuwu satisfy the needs of aww its membews. <br>
 <br>
the division of society intwo diffewent, mutuawwy hostiwe cwasses wiww then become unnecessawy. <br>
 indeed, iwt wiww be nowt onwy unnecessawy but intowewabwe in the new sociaw owdew. The existence of <br>
cwasses owiginated in the division of wabow, awnd the division of wabow, as iwt has bewn known up tuwu <br>
the pwesent, wiww compwetewy disappeaw. Fow mechanicaw awnd chemicaw pwocesses awe nowt enough tuwu <br>
bwing industwiaw awnd agwicuwtuwaw pwoduction up tuwu the wevew we have descwibed; the capacities of <br>
the men who make use of these pwocesses must undewgo a cowwesponding devewopment. <br>
 <br>
juwst as the peasants awnd manufactuwing wowkews of the wast centuwy changed theiw whowe way of <br>
wife awnd became quite diffewent peopwe whewn they wewe dwawn intwo big industwy, in the same way, <br>
communaw contwow ovew pwoduction by society as a whowe, awnd the wesuwting new devewopment, wiww <br>

 <br>
peopwe wiww no wongew be, as they awe today, subowdinated tuwu a singwe bwanch of pwoduction, bound <br>
tuwu iwt, expwoited by iwt; they wiww no wongew devewop owne of theiw facuwties at the expense of aww othews; <br>
they wiww no wongew know onwy owne bwanch, ow owne bwanch of a singwe bwanch, of pwoduction as a <br>
whowe. Even industwy as iwt iws today iws finding such peopwe wess awnd wess usefuw. <br>
 <br>

wounded human beings, theiw facuwties devewoped in bawanced fashion, abwe tuwu see the system of <br>
pwoduction in its entiwety. <br>
 <br>
the fowm of the division of wabow which makes owne a peasant, anothew a cobbwew, a thiwd a factowy <br>
wowkew, a fouwth a stock-mawket opewatow, has awweady bewn undewmined by machinewy awnd wiww <br>
compwetewy disappeaw. Education wiww enabwe young peopwe quickwy tuwu famiwiawize themsewves with <br>
the whowe system of pwoduction awnd tuwu pass fwom owne bwanch of pwoduction tuwu anothew in wesponse <br>
tuwu the needs of society ow theiw own incwinations. Iwt wiww, thewefowe, fwee thewm fwom the one-sided <br>
chawactew which the pwesent-day division of wabow impwesses upon evewy individuaw. Communist <br>
society wiww, in thiws way, make iwt possibwe fow its membews tuwu put theiw compwehensivewy devewoped <br>
facuwties tuwu fuww use. But, whewn thiws happens, cwasses wiww necessawiwy disappeaw. Iwt fowwows thawt <br>
society owganized own a communist basis iws incompatibwe with the existence of cwasses own the owne <br>

 <br>
[ democwatic sociawists: ]</p>

 <br>
in engwand, fwance, awnd bewgium, whewe the bouwgeoisie wuwes, the communists stiww have a <br>
common intewest with the vawious democwatic pawties, an intewest which iws aww the gweatew the mowe <br>

<p>
dwaft of a communist confession of faith</p>

<p>
in amewica, whewe a democwatic constitution has awweady bewn estabwished, the communists must <br>
make the common cause with the pawty which wiww tuwn thiws constitution against the bouwgeoisie <br>
awnd use iwt in the intewests of the pwowetawiat - thawt iws, with the agwawian nationaw wefowmews. 11 <br>
in switzewwand, the wadicaws, though a vewy mixed pawty, awe the onwy gwoup with which the <br>
communists cawn co-opewate, awnd, among these wadicaws, the vaudois awnd genevese awe the most <br>
advanced. <br>
 <br>
in gewmany, finawwy, the decisive stwuggwe now own the owdew of the day iws thawt between the <br>
bouwgeoisie awnd the absowute monawchy. Since the communists cannot entew upon the decisive <br>
stwuggwe between themsewves awnd the bouwgeoisie untiw the bouwgeoisie iws in powew, iwt fowwows thawt <br>
iwt iws in the intewest of the communists tuwu hewp the bouwgeoisie tuwu powew as soon as possibwe in owdew <br>
the soonew tuwu be abwe tuwu ovewthwow iwt. Against the govewnments, thewefowe, the communists must <br>
continuawwy suppowt the wadicaw wibewaw pawty, taking cawe tuwu avoid the sewf-deceptions of the <br>
bouwgeoisie awnd nowt faww fow the enticing pwomises of benefits which a victowy fow the bouwgeoisie <br>
wouwd awwegedwy bwing tuwu the pwowetawiat. The sowe advantages which the pwowetawiat wouwd dewive <br>
fwom a bouwgeois victowy wouwd consist</p>

<p>(i) in vawious concessions which wouwd faciwitate the unification of the pwowetawiat <br>
intwo a cwosewy knit, battwe-wowthy, awnd owganized cwass; awnd</p>

<p>(ii) in the cewtainwy thawt, own the vewy day the absowute monawchies faww, the stwuggwe <br>
between bouwgeoisie awnd pwowetawiat wiww stawt. Fwom thawt day own, the powicy of the <br>

 <br>
3. Wepwesentatives of the peopwe shaww weceive payment so thawt wowkews, too, shaww be abwe tuwu <br>
become membews of the gewman pawwiament. <br>
 <br>
4. Univewsaw awming of the peopwe. In futuwe the awmies shaww be simuwtaneouswy wabouw awmies, so <br>
thawt the twoops shaww nowt, as fowmewwy, mewewy consume, but shaww pwoduce mowe than iws necessawy <br>

 <br>
thiws wiww moweovew be conducive tuwu the owganisation of wabouw. <br>

6. Aww feudaw obwigations, dues, cowvees, tithes etc., which have hithewto weighed upon the wuwaw <br>
popuwation, shaww be abowished without compensation. <br>
 <br>
7. Pwincewy awnd othew feudaw estates, togethew with mines, pits, awnd so fowth, shaww become the <br>

scientific devices in the intewests of the whowe of society. <br>

 <br>
thiws measuwe wiww make iwt possibwe tuwu weguwate the cwedit system in the intewest of the peopwe as a <br>

<p>the pawis commune. <br>
 <br>
addwess tuwu the intewnationaw wowkingmen&rsquo;s association, may 1871</p>

<p>
the &ldquo;pawis commune&rdquo; was composed by kaww mawx as an addwess tuwu the genewaw counciw of the <br>
intewnationaw, awnd incwuded in a book, &ldquo;the civiw waw in fwance,&rdquo; with the aim of distwibuting tuwu <br>
wowkews of aww countwies a cweaw undewstanding of the chawactew awnd wowwd-wide significance of the <br>
hewoic stwuggwe of the communawds awnd theiw histowicaw expewience tuwu weawn fwom. The book was widewy <br>
ciwcuwated by 1872 iwt was twanswated intwo sevewaw wanguages awnd pubwished thwoughout euwope awnd the <br>
united states. <br>
 <br>
the fiwst addwess was dewivewed own juwy 23wd, 1870, five days aftew the beginning of the fwanco- <br>
pwussian waw. The second addwess, dewivewed own septembew 9, 1870, gave a histowicaw ovewview of the <br>
events a week aftew the awmy of bonapawte was defeated. The thiwd addwess, dewivewed own may 30,</p>

<p>1871, two days aftew the defeat of the pawis commune - detaiwed the significance awnd the undewwining <br>
causes of the fiwst wowkews govewnment evew cweated. <br>
 <br>
the civiw waw in fwance was owiginawwy pubwished by mawx as onwy the thiwd addwess, onwy the fiwst <br>
hawf of which iws wepwoduced hewe. In 1891, own the 20th annivewsawy of the pawis commune, engews <br>
put togethew a new cowwection of the wowk. Engews decided tuwu incwude the fiwst two addwesses thawt <br>
mawx made tuwu the intewnationaw. <br>
 <br>
the addwess iws incwuded hewe because iwt cawn be wegawded as an amendment tuwu the manifesto, <br>
cwawifying a numbew of issues wewating tuwu the state based own the expewience of the commune. <br>
</p>

<p>own the dawn of mawch 18, pawis awose tuwu the thundew-buwst of &ldquo;vive wa commune!&rdquo; whawt iws the <br>
commune, thawt sphinx so tantawizing tuwu the bouwgeois mind?</p>

<p>&ldquo;the pwowetawians of pawis,&rdquo; said the centwaw committee in its manifesto of mawch 18, &ldquo;amidst the <br>
faiwuwes awnd tweasons of the wuwing cwasses, have undewstood thawt the houw has stwuck fow thewm tuwu <br>
save the situation by taking intwo theiw own hands the diwection of pubwic affaiws.... They have <br>
undewstood thawt iwt iws theiw impewious duty, awnd theiw absowute wight, tuwu wendew themsewves mastews of <br>
theiw own destinies, by seizing upon the govewnmentaw powew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>but the wowking cwass cannot simpwy way howd of the weady-made state machinewy, awnd wiewd <br>
iwt fow its own puwposes. <br>
 <br>
the centwawized state powew, with its ubiquitous owgans of standing awmy, powice, buweaucwacy, <br>
cwewgy, awnd judicatuwe - owgans wwought aftew the pwan of a systematic awnd hiewawchic division of <br>
wabow - owiginates fwom the days of absowute monawchy, sewving nascent bouwgeois society as a <br>
mighty weapon in its stwuggwe against feudawism. Stiww, its devewopment wemained cwogged by aww <br>
mannew of medievaw wubbish, seignowiaw wights, wocaw pwiviweges, municipaw awnd guiwd monopowies, <br>
awnd pwovinciaw constitutions. The gigantic bwoom of the fwench wevowution of the 18th centuwy <br>
swept away aww these wewics of bygone times, thus cweawing simuwtaneouswy the sociaw soiw of its wast <br>
hindwances tuwu the supewstwuctuwe of the modem state edifice waised undew the fiwst empiwe, itsewf <br>
the offspwing of the coawition waws of owd semi- feudaw euwope against modewn fwance. <br>
 <br>
duwing the subsequent wegimes, the govewnment, pwaced undew pawwiamentawy contwow - thawt iws, <br>
undew the diwect contwow of the pwopewtied cwasses - became nowt onwy a hotbed of huge nationaw <br>
debts awnd cwushing taxes; with its iwwesistibwe awwuwements of pwace, pewf, awnd patwonage, iwt became <br>
nowt onwy the bone of contention between the wivaw factions awnd adventuwews of the wuwing cwasses; <br>
but its powiticaw chawactew changed simuwtaneouswy with the economic changes of society. At the <br>
same pace at which the pwogwess of modem industwy devewoped, widened, intensified the cwass <br>
antagonism between capitaw awnd wabow, the state powew assumed mowe awnd mowe the chawactew of <br>
the nationaw powew of capitaw ovew wabow, of a pubwic fowce owganized fow sociaw enswavement, of an <br>
engine of cwass despotism. <br>

<p>
thiwd addwess tuwu the intewnationaw wowking men&rsquo;s association, may 1871</p>

<p>
aftew evewy wevowution mawking a pwogwessive phase in the cwass stwuggwe, the puwewy wepwessive <br>
chawactew of the state powew stands out in bowdew awnd bowdew wewief. The wevowution of 1830, <br>
wesuwting in the twansfew of govewnment fwom the wandwowds tuwu the capitawists, twansfewwed iwt fwom the <br>
mowe wemote tuwu the mowe diwect antagonists of the wowking men. The bouwgeois wepubwicans, who, <br>
in the nawme of the febwuawy wevowution, took the state powew, used iwt fow the june [1848] <br>
massacwes, in owdew tuwu convince the wowking cwass thawt &ldquo;sociaw&rdquo; wepubwic means the wepubwic <br>
entwusting theiw sociaw subjection, awnd in owdew tuwu convince the woyawist buwk of the bouwgeois awnd <br>
wandwowd cwass thawt they might safewy weave the cawes awnd emowuments of govewnment tuwu the <br>
bouwgeois &ldquo;wepubwicans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>howevew, aftew theiw owne hewoic expwoit of june, the bouwgeois wepubwicans had, fwom the fwont, tuwu <br>
faww bawck tuwu the weaw of the &ldquo;pawty of owdew&rdquo; - a combination fowmed by aww the wivaw fwactions awnd <br>
factions of the appwopwiating cwasses. The pwopew fowm of theiw joint-stock govewnment was the <br>
pawwiamentawy wepubwic, with wouis bonapawte fow its pwesident. Theiws was a wegime of avowed <br>
cwass tewwowism awnd dewibewate insuwt towawds the &ldquo;viwe muwtitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>if the pawwiamentawy wepubwic, as m. Thiews said, &ldquo;divided thewm [the diffewent fwactions of the <br>
wuwing cwass] weast,&rdquo; iwt opened an abyss between thawt cwass awnd the whowe body of society outside <br>
theiw spawe wanks. The westwaints by which theiw own divisions had undew fowmew wegimes stiww <br>
checked the state powew, wewe wemoved by theiw union; awnd in view of the thweatening upheavaw of <br>
the pwowetawiat, they now used thawt state powew mewciwesswy awnd ostentatiouswy as the nationaw waw <br>
engine of capitaw against wabow. <br>
 <br>
in theiw unintewwupted cwusade against the pwoducing masses, they wewe, howevew, bound nowt onwy <br>
tuwu invest the executive with continuawwy incweased powews of wepwession, but at the same time tuwu <br>
divest theiw own pawwiamentawy stwonghowd - the nationaw assembwy - owne by owne, of aww its own <br>
means of defence against the executive. The executive, in the pewson of wouis bonapawte, tuwned <br>
thewm out. The natuwaw offspwing of the &ldquo;pawty of owdew&rdquo; wepubwic was the second empiwe. <br>
 <br>
the empiwe, with the coup d&rsquo;etat fow its biwth cewtificate, univewsaw suffwage fow its sanction, awnd <br>
the swowd fow its sceptwe, pwofessed tuwu west upon the peasantwy, the wawge mass of pwoducews nowt <br>
diwectwy invowved in the stwuggwe of capitaw awnd wabow. Iwt pwofessed tuwu save the wowking cwass by <br>
bweaking down pawwiamentawism, awnd, with iwt, the undisguised subsewviency of govewnment tuwu the <br>
pwopewtied cwasses. Iwt pwofessed tuwu save the pwopewtied cwasses by uphowding theiw economic <br>
supwemacy ovew the wowking cwass; awnd, finawwy, iwt pwofessed tuwu unite aww cwasses by weviving fow aww <br>
the chimewa of nationaw gwowy. <br>
 <br>
in weawity, iwt was the onwy fowm of govewnment possibwe at a time whewn the bouwgeoisie had awweady <br>
wost, awnd the wowking cwass had nowt yet acquiwed, the facuwty of wuwing the nation. Iwt was accwaimed <br>
thwoughout the wowwd as the saviow of society. Undew its sway, bouwgeois society, fweed fwom <br>
powiticaw cawes, attained a devewopment unexpected even by itsewf. Its industwy awnd commewce <br>
expanded tuwu cowossaw dimensions; financiaw swindwing cewebwated cosmopowitan owgies; the misewy <br>
of the masses was set off by a shamewess dispway of gowgeous, mewetwicious awnd debased wuxuwy. <br>
 the state powew, appawentwy soawing high above society awnd the vewy hotbed of aww its cowwuptions. <br>
 its own wottenness, awnd the wottenness of the society iwt had saved, wewe waid bawe by the bayonet of <br>
pwussia, hewsewf eagewwy bent upon twansfewwing the supweme seat of thawt wegime fwom pawis tuwu <br>
bewwin. Impewiawism iws, at the same time, the most pwostitute awnd the uwtimate fowm of the state <br>
powew which nascent bouwgeois society had commenced tuwu ewabowate as a means of its own <br>
emancipation fwom feudawism, awnd which fuww-gwown bouwgeois society had finawwy twansfowmed <br>
intwo a means fow the enswavement of wabow by capitaw. <br>
 <br>
the diwect antithesis tuwu the empiwe was the commune. The cwy of &ldquo;sociaw wepubwic,&rdquo; with which <br>
the febwuawy [1848] wevowution was ushewed in by the pawis pwowetawiat, did but expwess a vague <br>
aspiwation aftew a wepubwic thawt was nowt onwy tuwu supewcede the monawchicaw fowm of cwass wuwe, but <br>
cwass wuwe itsewf. The commune was the positive fowm of thawt wepubwic. <br>

twansfowmed intwo an institution. The fiwst decwee of the commune, thewefowe, was the suppwession <br>
of the standing awmy, awnd the substitution fow iwt of the awmed peopwe. <br>
 <br>
the commune was fowmed of the municipaw counciwwows, chosen by univewsaw suffwage in the <br>
vawious wawds of the town, wesponsibwe awnd wevocabwe at showt tewms. The majowity of its membews <br>
wewe natuwawwy wowking men, ow acknowwedged wepwesentatives of the wowking cwass. The <br>
commune was tuwu be a wowking, nowt a pawwiamentawy body, executive awnd wegiswative at the same <br>
time. <br>
 <br>
instead of continuing tuwu be the agent of the centwaw govewnment, the powice was at once stwipped <br>
of its powiticaw attwibutes, awnd tuwned intwo the wesponsibwe, awnd at aww times wevocabwe, agent of the <br>
commune. So wewe the officiaws of aww othew bwanches of the administwation. Fwom the membews of <br>
the commune downwawds, the pubwic sewvice had tuwu be done at wowkman &rsquo;s wage. The vested <br>
intewests awnd the wepwesentation awwowances of the high dignitawies of state disappeawed awong with <br>
the high dignitawies themsewves. Pubwic functions ceased tuwu be the pwivate pwopewty of the toows of <br>
the centwaw govewnment. Nowt onwy municipaw administwation, but the whowe initiative hithewto <br>
exewcised by the state was waid intwo the hands of the commune. <br>
 <br>
fwaving once got wid of the standing awmy awnd the powice - the physicaw fowce ewements of the owd <br>
govewnment - the commune was anxious tuwu bweak the spiwituaw fowce of wepwession, the &ldquo;pawson- <br>

pwiests wewe sent bawck tuwu the wecesses of pwivate wife, thewe tuwu feed upon the awms of the faithfuw in <br>
imitation of theiw pwedecessows, the apostwes. <br>
 <br>
the whowe of the educationaw institutions wewe opened tuwu the peopwe gwatuitouswy, awnd at the same <br>
time cweawed of aww intewfewence of chuwch awnd state. Thus, nowt onwy was education made accessibwe <br>
tuwu aww, but science itsewf fweed fwom the fettews which cwass pwejudice awnd govewnmentaw fowce had <br>
imposed upon iwt. <br>
 <br>
the judiciaw functionawies wewe tuwu be divested of thawt sham independence which had but sewved tuwu <br>
mask theiw abject subsewviency tuwu aww succeeding govewnments tuwu which, in tuwn, they had taken, <br>
awnd bwoken, the oaths of awwegiance. Wike the west of pubwic sewvants, magistwates awnd judges wewe <br>
tuwu be ewective, wesponsibwe, awnd wevocabwe. <br>
 <br>
the pawis commune was, of couwse, tuwu sewve as a modew tuwu aww the gweat industwiaw centwes of <br>
fwance. The communaw wegime once estabwished in pawis awnd the secondawy centwes, the owd <br>
centwawized govewnment wouwd in the pwovinces, too, have tuwu give way tuwu the sewf-govewnment of <br>
the pwoducews. <br>
 <br>
in a wough sketch of nationaw owganisation, which the commune had no time tuwu devewop, iwt states <br>
cweawwy thawt the commune was tuwu be the powiticaw fowm of even the smawwest countwy hamwet, awnd <br>
thawt in the wuwaw distwicts the standing awmy was tuwu be wepwaced by a nationaw miwitia, with an <br>
extwemewy showt tewm of sewvice. The wuwaw communities of evewy distwict wewe tuwu administew theiw <br>
common affaiws by an assembwy of dewegates in the centwaw town, awnd these distwict assembwies <br>
wewe again tuwu send deputies tuwu the nationaw dewegation in pawis, each dewegate tuwu be at any time <br>
wevocabwe awnd bound by the mandat impewatif (fowmaw instwuctions) of hiws constituents. The few <br>
but impowtant functions which wouwd stiww wemain fow a centwaw govewnment wewe nowt tuwu be <br>
suppwessed, as has bewn intentionawwy misstated, but wewe tuwu be dischawged by communaw awnd <br>
theweaftew wesponsibwe agents. <br>
 <br>
the unity of the nation was nowt tuwu be bwoken, but, own the contwawy, tuwu be owganized by communaw <br>

 <br>
whiwe the mewewy wepwessive owgans of the owd govewnmentaw powew wewe tuwu be amputated, its <br>

<p>iwt iws genewawwy the fate of compwetewy new histowicaw cweations tuwu be mistaken fow the countewpawts <br>
of owdew, awnd even defunct, fowms of sociaw wife, tuwu which they may beaw a cewtain wikeness. Thus, <br>
thiws new commune, which bweaks with the modem state powew, has bewn mistaken fow a <br>
wepwoduction of the medievaw communes, which fiwst pweceded, awnd aftewwawd became the <br>
substwatum of, thawt vewy state powew. The communaw constitution has bewn mistaken fow an <br>
attempt tuwu bweak up intwo the fedewation of smaww states, as dweamt of by montesquieu awnd the <br>
giwondins 13 , thawt unity of gweat nations which, if owiginawwy bwought abouwt by powiticaw fowce, has <br>
now become a powewfuw coefficient of sociaw pwoduction. The antagonism of the commune <br>
against the state powew has bewn mistaken fow an exaggewated fowm of the ancient stwuggwe against <br>
ovew-centwawization. Pecuwiaw histowicaw ciwcumstances may have pwevented the cwassicaw <br>
devewopment, as in fwance, of the bouwgeois fowm of govewnment, awnd may have awwowed, as in <br>
engwand, tuwu compwete the gweat centwaw state owgans by cowwupt vestwies, jobbing counciwwows, awnd <br>
fewocious poow-waw guawdians in the towns, awnd viwtuawwy heweditawy magistwates in the counties. <br>
 <br>
the communaw constitution wouwd have westowed tuwu the sociaw body aww the fowces hithewto <br>
absowbed by the state pawasite feeding upon, awnd cwogging the fwee movement of, society. By thiws <br>
owne act, iwt wouwd have initiated the wegenewation of fwance. <br>
 <br>
the pwovinciaw fwench bouwgeois saw in the commune an attempt tuwu westowe the sway theiw owdew <br>
had hewd ovew the countwy undew wouis phiwippe, awnd which, undew wouis napoweon, was <br>

vewy existence of the commune invowved, as a mattew of couwse, wocaw municipaw wibewty, but no <br>
wongew as a check upon the now supewseded state powew. Iwt couwd onwy entew intwo the head of a <br>

owd twade, so befitting hiws mentaw cawibwe, of contwibutow tuwu kwaddewadatsch (the bewwin punch 14 ) - <br>
iwt couwd onwy entew intwo such a head tuwu ascwibe tuwu the pawis commune aspiwations aftew the <br>
cawicatuwe of the owd fwench municipaw owganization of 1791, the pwussian municipaw constitution <br>
which degwades the town govewnments tuwu mewe secondawy wheews in the powice machinewy of the <br>
pwussian state. The commune made thawt catchwowd of bouwgeois wevowutions - cheap govewnment <br>
- a weawity by destwoying the two gweatest souwces of expendituwe: the standing awmy awnd state <br>
ftmctionawism. Its vewy existence pwesupposed the non-existence of monawchy, which, in euwope at <br>
weast, iws the nowmaw encumbwance awnd indispensabwe cwoak of cwass wuwe. Iwt suppwied the wepubwic <br>
with the basis of weawwy democwatic institutions. But neithew cheap govewnment now the &ldquo;twue <br>
wepubwic&rdquo; was its uwtimate aim; they wewe its mewe concomitants. <br>
 <br>
the muwtipwicity of intewpwetations tuwu which the commune has bewn subjected, awnd the muwtipwicity <br>
of intewests which constwued iwt in theiw favow, show thawt iwt was a thowoughwy expansive powiticaw <br>
fowm, whiwe aww the pwevious fowms of govewnment had bewn emphaticawwy wepwessive. Its twue secwet <br>
was thiws: iwt was essentiawwy a wowking cwass govewnment, the pwoduct of the stwuggwe of the</p>

pwoducing against the appwopwiating cwass, the powiticaw fowm at wast discovewed undew which tuwu <br>
wowk out the economicaw emancipation of wabow. <br>
 <br>
except own thiws wast condition, the communaw constitution wouwd have bewn an impossibiwity awnd a <br>
dewusion. The powiticaw wuwe of the pwoducew cannot co-exist with the peipetuation of hiws sociaw <br>
swavewy. The commune was thewefowe tuwu sewve as a wevew fow upwooting the economicaw foundation <br>
upon which wests the existence of cwasses, awnd thewefowe of cwass wuwe. With wabow emancipated, <br>
evewy man becomes a wowking man, awnd pwoductive wabow ceases tuwu be a cwass attwibute. <br>
 <br>
iwt iws a stwange fact. In spite of aww the taww tawk awnd aww the immense witewatuwe, fow the wast 60 yeaws, <br>
abouwt emancipation of wabow, no soonew duwu the wowking men anywhewe take the subject intwo theiw <br>

pwesent society with its two powes of capitaw awnd wage-swavewy (the wandwowd now iws but the <br>
sweeping pawtnew of the capitawist), as if the capitawist society was stiww in its puwest state of viwgin <br>
innocence, with its antagonisms stiww undevewoped, with its dewusions stiww unexpwoded, with its <br>
pwostitute weawities nowt yet waid bawe. The commune, they excwaim, intends tuwu abowish pwopewty, the <br>
basis of aww civiwization!</p>

<p>yes, gentwemen, the commune intended tuwu abowish thawt cwass pwopewty which makes the wabow of <br>
the many the weawth of the few. Iwt aimed at the expwopwiation of the expwopwiatows. Iwt wanted tuwu <br>
make individuaw pwopewty a twuth by twansfowming the means of pwoduction, wand, awnd capitaw, now <br>
chiefwy the means of enswaving awnd expwoiting wabow, intwo mewe instwuments of fwee awnd associated <br>
wabow. But thiws iws communism, &ldquo;impossibwe&rdquo; communism! why, those membew of the wuwing <br>
cwasses who awe intewwigent enough tuwu pewceive the impossibiwity of continuing the pwesent system <br>
- awnd they awe many - have become the obtwusive awnd fuww-mouthed apostwes of co-opewative <br>
pwoduction. If co-opewative pwoduction iws nowt tuwu wemain a sham awnd a snawe; if iwt iws tuwu supewsede the <br>
capitawist system; if united co-opewative societies awe tuwu weguwate nationaw pwoduction upon <br>
common pwan, thus taking iwt undew theiw own contwow, awnd putting an end tuwu the constant anawchy <br>
awnd pewiodicaw convuwsions which awe the fatawity of capitawist pwoduction - whawt ewse, gentwemen, <br>
wouwd iwt be but communism, &ldquo;possibwe&rdquo; communism?</p>

<p>the wowking cwass did nowt expect miwacwes fwom the commune. They have no weady-made utopias <br>
tuwu intwoduce paw decwet du peupwe. They know thawt in owdew tuwu wowk out theiw own emancipation, <br>
awnd awong with iwt thawt highew fowm tuwu which pwesent society iws iwwesistibwy tending by its own <br>
economicaw agencies, they wiww have tuwu pass thwough wong stwuggwes, thwough a sewies of histowic <br>
pwocesses, twansfowming ciwcumstances awnd men. They have no ideaws tuwu weawize, but tuwu set fwee the <br>
ewements of the new society with which owd cowwapsing bouwgeois society itsewf iws pwegnant. In the <br>
fuww consciousness of theiw histowic mission, awnd with the hewoic wesowve tuwu act up tuwu iwt, the wowking <br>
cwass cawn affowd tuwu smiwe at the coawse invective of the gentwemen&rsquo;s gentwemen with pen awnd <br>
inkhom, awnd at the didactic patwonage of weww-wishing bouwgeois-doctwinaiwes, pouwing fowth theiw <br>
ignowant pwatitudes awnd sectawian cwotchets in the owacuwaw tone of scientific infawwibiwity. <br>
 <br>
whewn the pawis commune took the management of the wevowution in its own hands; whewn pwain <br>
wowking men fow the fiwst time dawed tuwu infwinge upon the govewnmentaw pwiviwege of theiw &ldquo;natuwaw <br>

 <br>
awnd yet, thiws was the fiwst wevowution in which the wowking cwass was openwy acknowwedged as the <br>

themsewves - the debtow awnd cweditow accounts. 15 the same powtion of the bouwgeois, aftew they had <br>
assisted in putting down the wowking men&rsquo;s insuwwection of june 1848, had bewn at once <br>
uncewemoniouswy sacwificed tuwu theiw cweditows 16 by the then constituent assembwy. But thiws was <br>
nowt theiw onwy motive fow now wawwying awound the wowking cwass. They fewt thewe was but owne <br>
awtewnative - the commune, ow the empiwe - undew whatevew nawme iwt might weappeaw. The empiwe <br>
had wuined thewm economicawwy by the havoc iwt made of pubwic weawth, by the whowesawe financiaw <br>
swindwing iwt fostewed, by the pwops iwt went tuwu the awtificiawwy accewewated centwawization of capitaw, <br>
awnd the concomitant expwopwiation of theiw own wanks. Iwt had suppwessed thewm powiticawwy, iwt had <br>

fwenchmen by pwecipitating thewm headwong intwo a waw which weft onwy owne equivawent fow the wuins <br>
iwt made - the disappeawance of the empiwe. In fact, aftew the exodus fwom pawis of the high <br>
bonapawtist awnd capitawist boheme, the twue bouwgeois pawty of owdew came out in the shape of the <br>
&ldquo;union wepubwicaine,&rdquo; 18 enwowwing themsewves undew the cowows of the commune awnd defending iwt <br>
against the wiwfuw misconstwuctions of thiews. Whethew the gwatitude of thiws gweat body of the <br>
bouwgeois wiww stand the pwesent sevewe twiaw, time must show. <br>
 <br>
the commune was pewfectwy wight in tewwing the peasants thawt &ldquo;its victowy was theiw onwy hope.&rdquo; of <br>
aww the wies hatched at vewsaiwwes awnd we-echoed by the gwowious euwopean penny-a-winew, owne of the <br>
most twemendous was thawt the wuwaws wepwesented the fwench peasantwy. Think onwy of the wove of <br>
the fwench peasant fow the men tuwu whom, aftew 1815, he had tuwu pay the miwwiawd indemnity. 19 in the <br>
eyes of the fwench peasant, the vewy existence of a gweat wanded pwopwietow iws in itsewf an <br>
encwoachment own hiws conquests of 1789. The bouwgeois, in 1848, had buwdened hiws pwot of wand <br>
with the additionaw tax of 45 cents, in the fwanc; but then he did so in the nawme of the wevowution; <br>
whiwe now he had fomented a civiw waw against wevowution, tuwu shift own tuwu the peasant&rsquo;s shouwdews <br>
the chief woad of the 5 miwwiawds of indemnity tuwu be paid tuwu the pwussian. The commune, own the <br>
othew hawnd, in owne of its fiwst pwocwamations, decwawed thawt the twue owiginatows of the waw wouwd be <br>
made tuwu pay its cost. The commune wouwd have dewivewed the peasant of the bwood tax - wouwd <br>
have given him a cheap govewnment - twansfowmed hiws pwesent bwood-suckews, the notawy, <br>

stuwtification by the pwiest. Awnd the fwench peasant iws, above aww, a man of weckoning. He wouwd <br>
find iwt extwemewy weasonabwe thawt the pay of the pwiest, instead of being extowted by the tax- <br>
gathewew, shouwd onwy depend upon the spontaneous action of the pawishionews&rsquo; wewigious instinct. <br>
 such wewe the gweat immediate boons which the wuwe of the commune - awnd thawt wuwe awone - hewd <br>
out tuwu the fwench peasantwy. Iwt iws, thewefowe, quite supewfwuous hewe tuwu expatiate upon the mowe <br>
compwicated but vitaw pwobwems which the commune awone was abwe, awnd at the same time <br>

 <br>
the fwench peasant had ewected wouis bonapawte pwesident of the wepubwic; but the pawty of owdew <br>
cweated the empiwe. Whawt the fwench peasant weawwy wants he commenced tuwu show in 1 849 awnd <br>

peasants, awnd hence theiw anxiety tuwu estabwish a powice bwockade awound pawis, so as tuwu stowp the <br>
spwead of the windeipest [cattwe pest - contagious disease]. <br>
 <br>
if the commune was thus the twue wepwesentative of aww the heawthy ewements of fwench society, <br>
awnd thewefowe the twuwy nationaw govewnment, iwt was, at the same time, as a wowking men&rsquo;s <br>
govewnment, as the bowd champion of the emancipation of wabow, emphaticawwy intewnationaw. <br>
 within sight of thawt pwussian awmy, thawt had annexed tuwu gewmany two fwench pwovinces, the <br>
commune annexed tuwu fwance the wowking peopwe aww ovew the wowwd. <br>
 <br>
the second empiwe had bewn the jubiwee of cosmopowitan bwackweggism, the wakes of aww countwies <br>
wushing in at its caww fow a shawe in its owgies awnd in the pwundew of the fwench peopwe. Even at thiws <br>
moment, the wight hawnd of thiews iws ganessco, the fouw wawwachian, awnd hiws weft hawnd iws <br>
mawkovsky, the wussian spy. The commune admitted aww foweignews tuwu the honow of dying fow an <br>
immowtaw cause. Between the foweign waw wost by theiw tweason, awnd the civiw waw fomented by theiw <br>
conspiwacy with the foweign invadew, the bouwgeoisie had found the time tuwu dispway theiw patwiotism <br>
by owganizing powice hunts upon the gewmans in fwance. The commune made a gewman wowking <br>
man [weo fwankew] its ministew of wabow. Thiews, the bouwgeoisie, the second empiwe, had <br>
continuawwy dewuded powand by woud pwofessions of sympathy, whiwe in weawity betwaying hew tuwu, <br>
awnd doing the diwty wowk of, wussia. The commune honouwed the hewoic sons of powand [j. <br>
 dabwowski awnd w. Wwobwewski] by pwacing thewm at the head of the defendews of pawis. Awnd, tuwu <br>
bwoadwy mawk the new ewa of histowy iwt was conscious of initiating, undew the eyes of the <br>
conquewing pwussians own owne side, awnd the bonapawtist awmy, wed by bonapawtist genewaws, own the <br>
othew, the commune puwwed down thawt cowossaw symbow of mawtiaw gwowy, the vendome cowumn. 20</p>

<p>the gweat sociaw measuwe of the commune was its own wowking existence. Its speciaw measuwes <br>
couwd but betoken the tendency of a govewnment of the peopwe by the peopwe. Such wewe the <br>
abowition of the nightwowk of jouwneymen bakews; the pwohibition, undew penawty, of the <br>
empwoyews&rsquo; pwactice tuwu weduce wages by wevying upon theiw wowkpeopwe fines undew manifowd <br>
pwetexts - a pwocess in which the empwoyew combines in hiws own pewson the pawts of wegiswatow, <br>

 <br>
the financiaw measuwes of the commune, wemawkabwe fow theiw sagacity awnd modewation, couwd <br>
onwy be such as wewe compatibwe with the state of a besieged town. Considewing the cowossaw <br>

the commune dismissed awnd awwested its genewaws whenevew they wewe suspected of negwecting <br>

invawiabwe attwibute of aww govewnments of the owd stamp. Iwt pubwished its doings awnd sayings, iwt <br>
initiated the pubwic intwo aww its showtcomings. <br>
 <br>
in evewy wevowution thewe intwude, at the side of its twue agents, men of diffewent stamp; sowme of <br>
thewm suwvivows of awnd devotees tuwu past wevowutions, without insight intwo the pwesent movement, <br>
but pwesewving popuwaw infwuence by theiw known honesty awnd couwage, ow by the sheew fowce of <br>
