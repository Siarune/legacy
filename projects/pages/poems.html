                To, Sleep<br>
                Why have you forsaken me?<br><br>
                I lay here tired<br>
                In worry mired<br>
                Trying to fall asleep<br>
                But my family's loud as fuck<br>
                And cringy memories are stuck<br>
                So I guess I'll just count some sheep

                Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
                To smoke some crack cocaine.<br>
                Jack tried to boast<br>
                and upped the dose,<br>
                And Jill took all the blame.<br>

            <h3>not a poem, but parodies are close enough</h3>
            
            <p class="words">
                Grandpa got shot down by a muslim<br>
                Coming home from Iran Christmas Eve<br>
                Mom really thought that he would make it,<br>
                But as for me and Dad, we just grieve.<br>
                <br>
                Gonna have the funeral late this Wednesday.<br>
                Carry down the coffin half-past three.<br>
                Soldiers do the flag and gun salute thing,<br>
                Too bad Mom got shot in the knee.<br>
                <br>
                Oh~ Grandpa got shot down by a muslim<br>
                And Mom went back to drinking every night.<br>
                Dad said she just needed time for mourning,<br>
                If only I hadn't left her with a knife.<br>
                <br>
                So~ Grandpa got shot down by a muslim,<br>
                And Mom just committed suicide.<br>
                Dad says that he'll be alright<br>
                I just really hope he doesn't choose to die.<br>
